\chapter*{Dedication and acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{H}ere goes the dedication. Let's start with persistence in the face of the many challenges and the help and support of many people who encouraged and guided me as the many challenges of life and research emerged.

The many failures also shaped the research and the learnings through the PhD journey. I have about as many abandoned and rejected papers as those which were accepted. 

This work was inspired through my work with real-world developers of very successful mobile apps through the early and juvenile years of mobile app development (from 2006 to 2013) where I learned of the power and potential of using mobile analytics to improve the software and how teams create, test and support that software.

To Sheep Dalton who was my co-supervisor at the start and until I completed the probation report, he  provided rich and fresh ideas and insights as I was shaping my research.

There's more to add before this thesis is complete. For now, this will do.
