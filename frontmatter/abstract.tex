% \textbf{What was the purpose of your research?} 
\initial{T}his research explores the potential of using two complementary sources of data to improve the testing of Android apps. Google provides the first source, known as Android Vitals, using data gathered from Android devices of  users who opt-in to providing various performance data. Google claims \textit{"Exhibiting bad behavior in vitals will negatively affect the user experience in your app and is likely to result in bad ratings and poor discoverability on the Play Store"}% https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals
, therefore testing for these behaviors can help teams address bad behaviors to reduce the adverse effects on users and on the discoverability of the app.
% Possibly remove the second source from the mini-thesis, discuss.
The second source is gathered by the app, either directly or using a third-party library. Mobile analytics is a  well-established approach to gathering data from apps and may be a viable approach to provide this service. Logging is another mature approach but seldom used by mobile apps. This research aims to provide insights into commonalities and differences between logging and mobile analytics as implementations for this second source of data.
The improvements to testing include several distinct aspects: to help us review and assess the effects of our testing of apps now in production, to aid in bug localisation and reproduction, and to generate ideas and insights for future testing.
% investigates aspects of using data generated by software 

% \textbf{How was your research designed?}
% From the perspective of within the development team.
The research uses several mature opensource Android apps with active install bases of over 300,000 to evaluate Android Vitals, these apps do not collect any in-app data to protect the privacy of their users. Physical Android devices, selected by analysing data obtained from Android Vitals, were used to evaluate bug localisation and reproduction. We created software to 'scrape' data from Android Vitals in order to obtain the relevant data from the 1,000's of crash traces; Google do not provide an API.

% Possibly comment-out the following paragraph depending on how hermetic we want this mini-thesis to be...
The research was designed to incorporate mobile analytics libraries to one or more Android apps. Practical difficulties in finding a suitable existing project led to the development of a small prototype opensource Android app. 

% \textbf{What were your findings?} 
Several of the more popular Android apps had unusually high crash rates and crashes were more frequent on newer releases of Android. % Secondary finding: nonetheless the apps had high ratings in Google Play.
Android Vitals gathers non-personally identifiable information for Android apps. They also only provide reports and related data once volumes are sufficient to pass Google's thresholds to protect the privacy of uses, which means Android Vitals is less useful for apps with lower userbases. % TBD whether we can quantify the thresholds for when Google chooses to display various reports.
Android Vitals is in active development by Google with changes and features occurring several times during the research; I discovered bugs in Android Vitals and reported them to Google who acknowledged they would fix several of them; (the discussions are ongoing and Google are very interested in this aspect of my research).
Several bugs were hard to reproduce, partly as Google deliberately remove some pertinent details from the crash reports they gather. The data and reports was useful to devise new tests for the apps.

% \textbf{What were your conclusions?}
Android Vitals shows the potential of how the combination of their app store and platform could be used to help evaluate the effectiveness of testing of the apps being used by end-users, nonetheless some crashes were hard to reproduce and may be impractical to find before the app is released to end users. Developers may be able to determine comparative improvements in their releases, such as whether they have fixed a bug, by using Android Vitals; \textit{i.e.} scores and reports based on Android Vitals may help teams to determine whether they have improved the quality of their Android app \textit{even if they are not able to test as much as they might wish}.
