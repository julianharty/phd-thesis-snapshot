The purpose of this research is to learn whether mobile analytics could help
real-world developers improve the quality of their apps efficiently and effectively. The success of their apps may depend, at least in part, on how their apps are rated using externally determined metrics established by an app store.

Research Design: the research takes a developer-oriented perspective of using two complementary sources of data: 1) platform-level analytics, using Android Vitals as the primary analytics tool, and 2) in-app analytics.
%
Action research techniques included roles of embedded developer, guide, and observer across different projects I was involved in. Hackathons were used to experiment with the speed and ability to find and address issues reported in the analytics tools. 
%
I designed the research to facilitate ease of future research and reproducibility,~\emph{e.g.} by using  open-source projects as the code, bug reports, and so on are all published and available. Their apps have a combined active user base of over 500,000 users. One of these apps uses a mainstream crash analytics library which was used to complement and contrast the results provided in the primary analytics tool.
%
This research was complemented by collaborating with professional developers who provided additional examples and results.

Using mobile analytics helped to reduce crash rates markedly, quickly and effectively by applying techniques described here.
Various limitations and flaws were found in the analytics tools, these provide cause for concern as they may affect the app's placement in the app store, revenues, and also make some issues in the apps harder to identify, prioritise, and fix. We identified ways to compensate for many of these and developed open-source software to facilitate additional analysis. Flaws and bugs were reported to the Android Vitals team at Google who acknowledged they would fix several of them (discussions are ongoing).
%
Several bugs were hard to reproduce, partly as Google deliberately hide some pertinent details from the data they gather. Nonetheless the developers were able to ameliorate or fix the bugs for some issues even when they were not able to reproduce them. 

Android Vitals shows the potential of how the combination of an app store and platform could be used to improve the quality of apps without users needing to actively participate. Some crashes were hard to reproduce and may be impractical to find before the app is released to end users. Developers can determine comparative improvements in their releases, such as whether they fixed a bug, by using Android Vitals and similar analytics tools; \textit{i.e.} mobile analytics may help teams to determine whether they have improved the quality of their app \textit{even with flaws and limitations in the mobile analytics}.
