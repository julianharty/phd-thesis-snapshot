\section{Field Reports from Commercial App Developers}~\label{section-field-reports-case-studies}
The research includes field reports from developers of three distinct commercial Android apps. Each uses mobile analytics in their regular software development practices.

\subsection{Characteristics of the commercial apps}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technologies
    \item Analytics available to the team
    \item Development priorities for their use of analytics

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:av-moonpig-top-real-time-crashes-10-jun-2019} Android Vitals shows the most frequent crash clusters for the production releases of the Moonpig Android app. The majority of crashes were an \texttt{IllegalStateException} in a third-party library SpiceManager, part of the RoboSpice opensource project https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice . 

This crash is an excellent example of how changes and new developments in the ecosystem can render what was reliable working software into software that is no longer fit for purpose, \emph{i.e.} RoboSpice was developed in 2012 to help developers simplify coding of asynchronous networking requests https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice and the library worked really well at the time and for several years afterwards. It became popular as a result and was used widely by many teams, including at Moonpig. However, as the Google Android platform morphed some of the changes to Android were incompatible with RoboSpice. And with Android Oreo (Release 8.0) changes to the way background services worked broke the functionality of the library sufficiently that the project was archived by the creator and project owner https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/issues/467 

For apps that used RoboSpice the crash rate increased on the newer releases of Android, for example Figure~\ref{fig:av-moonpig-crash-rate-groupings} shows the crash rates by Android version were lowest on Android 7, higher for Android 8 and 8.1, and significantly higher again for Android 9. The teams needed to allocate time and energy to finding a suitable alternative to RoboSpice and then implement and test the new approach. Android Vitals helped provide an indication of the effects of the crashed and therefore provided evidence the development team could use to assess and prioritise the work.

I love Android vitals - especially \textbf{core vitals}. Seeing your app in comparison to apps of peers provides some great motivation to step up your game. The only issue I have with core vitals is that I can't see them all! We are by no means a big app, so don't have enough data to meet googles standard for anonymised results, so results for most of the core vitals are hidden. I don't quite understand why this should be the case as the headline figure of your apps performance surely doesn't have to rely on anonymous data? Whereas the drilled down details of a core vital should be anonymous, so maybe the details view could just be blocked instead of hiding the entire core vital? To give context, MoodSpace has at least 4k monthly users, so there must be plenty of apps which get little or no use form core vitals, simply from them being hidden.

As for the other tools Google provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ANR \& crashes} - I usually use crashlytics, so never really use this tab. the reason being, that the play console used to be very unreliable for crashes. But by the looks of it, it seems to have improved a lot, and pretty much matches the crashes I see in crashlytics now. Looking at it now, I actually noticed an ANR which could probably be fixed!
    \item \textbf{Pre launch reports} - I don't usually use this. Although this tool provides a nice safety net, it's quite basic, so any bugs that would cause the pre launch tests to fail have been found pre uploading through some quick manual testing. I actually ended up ignoring most pre launch reports when accessibility problems used to trigger failures, as we don't really have the resources to handle accessibility for now. But this seems to have changed in the last few months and accessibility problems don't cause a host of errors - maybe a way to ignore issues would be useful? In fact, pre-launch reports currently don't run on my app and fail with an incompatible apk error, not too sure why thats the case...
    \item \textbf{App signing} - very useful! and always use this since it was added.
    \item \textbf{Seperate release tracks} - love them! Especially since the addition of the internal track. The only issue was that I couldn't easily distribute debug versions of the app from the play store, and had to use a 3rd party tool to achieve that. Although Google have recently added Internal app sharing which should remedy that problem - however, I haven't figured out how to integrate that into our continuous integration process quite yet.
    \item \textbf{App bundles} - I'm still trying to integrate this, but as our new apps going to be heavily illustrated, this should cut our apk size significantly
\end{itemize}

As for several things I think are missing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A gradle plugin to integrate play store uploading into CI processes. I currently use a 3rd party plugin to do this, but it would feel a little more secure if it came from Google.
    \item Top line core vitals figures even if you don't have enough users!
    \item Someway for testers to download old apks from either internal app sharing, or the internal release track.
\end{itemize}

I've attached the ANR and crash rates for the app. As I say, I usually use Firebase crashlytics, so don't really fix crash issues from Play store data.

You're welcome to use any data or comments in your research! If you do use it, please send over a copy.

I think there's two things which has helped keep the app quite stable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app has the benefit that it's been around for quite a while without any major features being added. So most updates have been small and incremental, which has gradually increased it's stability. (This may change when the new, big update drops...)
    \item The app doesn't use any api, so all datas stored in very fast ORM databases like object-box (and uses memory caching). This enables the app to be mostly synchronous, which hugely cuts down on complexity of code. i.e. no need to handle loading, errors, or concurrency. This is a bit benefit! And cuts down on errors significantly, with no real impact on performance for users. To illustrate that it has little impact on users, I use firebase performance to run a trace on some methods that call the ORM/cache - it's peak duration is 40ms while the majority of calls take 3-6 ms.
\end{itemize} 

Crashlytics only covers the crash report of Android vitals, so unfortunately there's no way to get things like battery usage of ANR reports unless Google makes those reports available :(. In terms of crashes, I'd always prefer Crashlytics to Android vitals, simply because there are added features like non-fatal reporting and logs which can make surfacing the cause of errors much easier (but do take need added effort to integrate compared to android vitals).

\subsubsection{Experiences of using mobile analytics}
Localhalo incorporate two analytics libraries into their cross-platform mobile application: sentry for crash reporting and mixpanel for business-oriented usage analytics. For their Android app they also have access to Google Play Console.

They experience numerous crashes reported by Sentry, which occur within the React Native runtime environment. Sentry provides email alerts to the development team together with summary reports, (Figure~\ref{fig:localhalo-sentry-weekly-report-21-sep-2020} is example for the period~\nth{14} to~\nth{21} September 2020), and online access to their analytics.

A release in March 2020 had a high crash rate for the production release of their Android app. The top crash cluster was for:

\texttt{java.lang.RuntimeExceptionhost.exp.exponent.experience.a\$b.run}. 

This was traced to a problem in the expo library they used in the app~\url{https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/5839}. In that issue several developers for different Android apps provide data from Google Play Console confirming they also receive similar crash clusters. The cause has not yet been definitively traced or addressed, however for the LocalHalo app the crashes stopped being reported once a new release of the Android app, release 1.3.0, was released around \nth{6} April 2020.

Data missing from reports from~\nth{17} March to~\nth{25} March 2020 which affected the statistics around the time of the crashes related to Expo. Figure~\ref{fig:sentry-missing-data-march-2020} illustrates the gap across the two weekly reports. 

SHOULD-DO Consider summarising the crash totals per week. 

\textbf{MUST-DO} write up what we learn from the localhalo case study. external libraries can adversely affect the reliability of apps. Even small development teams can and do use multiple mobile analytics libraries. What can developers learn from the various reports provided by Sentry? How does cross-platform development in react-native affect the app reliability? are there crashes that only occur on Android or iOS? What's the correlation between crashes reported in Android Vitals and Sentry?
