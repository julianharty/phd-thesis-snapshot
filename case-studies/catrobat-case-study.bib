    Actual Behavior: Recoverable crashes after a cold start lead to reported crashes on the play console. 
    Expected Behavior: Recoverable crashes should be logged and fixed internally.
    Set number of background processes to 0, tap into an activity and switch between Pocket Code and another application. This leads to crashes that we recover from, but are still reported to the play console. We should try to catch those for now and fix them properly later.},
