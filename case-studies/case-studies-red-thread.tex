\section{Red Thread for the Case Studies}
\label{section-case-studies-red-thread}

Each case study needs to be formatted consistently so that the reader can find and compare any of them with any of the others, and establish patterns and connections as they're reading them, if indeed there are intentional patterns, orderings, and so on (beyond chronological).


TODO connect with ``Empirical research methods in software engineering"~\citep{Wohlin2003_empirical_research_methods_in_software_engineering}.

\marian{For each case study document the: case, methods, purpose}

\newthought{Joe's suggestions}
Format as a mini-paper with an abstract per case study.
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item What research questions does it answer?
    \item What’s the context? Mobile app? Web? Reporting tools? Library?
    \item What’s the company? Org structure? Communication tools?
    \item What tools were used? MS App Center, Android Vitals, etc. Crashlytics, Testing Frameworks, Collaboration tools,
    \item Team structure?
    \item How many users?
    \item Do the devs have access to the tools? how integrated into the development practices?
    \item Future work for each case study.
\end{itemize}

\newthought{Revised set of Marian's comments from our call on \nth{1} Sept 2021}

The map is vital. 
You need to be more precise in how you report the methodology, e.g., the case studies actually use mixed methods (not just the expansion). A methodology combines reasoning with the method. You need to convey rigour within the constraints of access to case studies.

At some point, you need a 'map' of the case studies:  case, methods, purpose...  This should give the reader an overview of what each contributes and where they overlap.

Maximise my ability to make systematic use of what was pragmatically available: Opportunistic access, then I worked systematically and rigorously. Demonstrating the demands of rigour is vital. Explicit reporting of what I had and the efforts I made to handle the data systematically and be vigilant for bias. This helps avoid the case studies being considered as anecdotal. Amplify with the dialogues I had as part of the teams.

Start with what data did I collect and how I collected it. The case studies with similar sources of data can be compared which multiply the contribution.

Aim to explain what are the issues that arose in each case study?
A clear rationale needs to be provided. 

It's wise for the thesis to demonstrate there's a really clear audit trail and justification for the conclusions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Characterise the case studies.
    \item Make explicit what data was collected and for what purpose. 
    \item Separate insights into a separate table. 
\end{itemize}

For Marian the conceptual prerequisite tree is unclear, it has:
2 threads of enquiry
Do the boxes have the same magnitude.

I clarified the prerequisites are prerequisites to effective application of mobile analytics. The figure is of a framework either corroborates or revises the approach. It could become an actionable list. Each item identifies a potential points of failure. Or it could be used as a retrospective of the factors I observed. 
It could be used to reflect on practice.

It breaks the topics down 

Quality of reporting of the empirical work is key

Next call with Marian starts at 10:15 on Friday 10th Sept.

Separate the reporting from the discussion.

\subsection{Classifications of Mobile Analytics tools}
The case studies also facilitated the study of various mobile analytics tools. A map of these tools and the case studies they were used in may help the reader (and the author). Here are suggested topics to consider for each of these tools.
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item To consider: which projects was the tool used in/relevant to?
    \item What was the tool used for?
    \item What insights did we glean from using the tool?
    \item If anythings made the tool distinctive, what were those things and why are they distinctive in the context of developers using mobile analytics?
\end{itemize}
