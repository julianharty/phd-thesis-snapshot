\section{Research in logging practices}
After covering various aspects of logging in proprietary apps and codebases, this section addresses three topics with a common focus on logging and logging tools available in opensource projects. It covers two aspects, with a subsequent discussion on the design and testing of logging:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysis of third-party opensource Android apps that incorporate Firebase Analytics.
    \item Tools we created to facilitate the testing and analysis of logging by Android developers.
    \item Discussion in methods to improve the effectiveness of logging and the analysis of log messages generated by apps.
\end{enumerate}

When developers incorporate mobile analytics in their apps, what do they use them for? 

In earlier case studies in this thesis several commercial developers shared their practices informally. This case study complements their insights by analysing 107 opensource Android projects that use Google's Firebase Analytics (the most popular and prevalent in-app analytics tool) to answer two research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the characteristics of logging practices with mobile analytics?
    \item What do developers log with mobile analytics?
\end{enumerate}

This research was performed jointly with an international group of researchers, all-bar-one, met at the~\textit{\nth{152 }NII Shonan meeting~\citep{nii_shonan_workshop_152}} where a group of us agreed to investigate the use of logging in mobile applications as a follow-up activity. We wrote and submitted our first paper in October 2020 where I am the first author. The paper is currently under review. The materials are available as an opensource project at \url{https://github.com/mobileanalyticslogs/mobileanalyticslogging/}.



Early research explored ways developers of opensource Android apps use local logging, a complementary and oft used approach intended to help developers learn more about how their app behaves locally at run-time. 



MUST-DO continue to write up our post-shonan paper.

\subsection{Discussion on practical aspects for the design, incorporation, and testing of logging} \label{apx:practical-aspects-for-design-and-incorporation-of-logging}
%This appendix introduces various practical aspects of incorporation of mobile analytics that are not necessary to understand the overall approach. The intention is to help those who would be actively involved in the concepts and approach described in the core thesis.
This introduces germane aspects of the design and incorporation of logging...



\subsection{Designing logging}
Unstructured logging can serve immediate needs, for instance to trace code execution or display the value of a variable at run-time. The resulting entries into a log file have limited value in terms of longer term analysis and they may also be harder to identify, filter, and lack relevant content for such analysis.

In the domain of logging both business and research consider logging design important and valuable.
