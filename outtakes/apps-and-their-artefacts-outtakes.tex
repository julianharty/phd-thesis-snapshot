\section{Normal and acceptable ranges of failures}
For the GTAF case study, the crash rates, as measured by Android Vitals, vary massively by release of the app (Al Quran (Tafsir \& by Word).\pending{A great deal more analysis is possible given the number of active apps and the ongoing access to Google Play Console.} 

Android Vitals does not report any failures in the GTAF taskinator app, which is created using React Native according to the development team. This is pertinent as similar behaviours in Android Vitals were observed for another app-centric case study, LocalHalo.
