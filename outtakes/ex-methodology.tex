Commented out after adding the grouping suggested with Marian on \nth{22} Oct 2021. Preserved until this chapter is in better shape.

\julian{Conflations: 1) data collection methods and analysis 2) contributors and goals also conflated. Action: Group rows by what I was targeting: I need to provide the rationale for the methods I used.} Two suggested groupings to try:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 Groupings: Tool outputs, validation, action research. 
    \item 4 Groupings: beacons-and-drill-downs, comparisons, contextualisation and clarification, evaluation through action research.
\end{itemize}

% Thanks to https://fedoramagazine.org/latex-typesetting-part-1/ for helping me discover {description} and for enabling me to find workarounds when it didn't render as I'd expected e.g. where I needed to add [$\bullet$] to stop it interpreting [Semi-] as a style.
