\section{Related Work Methodology Outtakes}
Marian suggests I aim for writing brief, one-paragraph summaries and apply the T tactic of the broad literature, the top bar of the T are the many and various papers on a topic, and I'm picking these ones that are most directly germane to my research which become the vertical bar of the T.\todo{I'm still currently more verbose than this :(} 

Marian also suggested I might end up with two or a maximum of 3 levels of Ts. The higher level would be on Software Quality Improvement. The lower level would be on mobile analytics.

\section{Software Development}
% For the purposes of this research there are at least two camps in research. The first camp is where the research comes from the field and is applied in the field of production, shipping software and the second camp seeks ways to improve the tools, techniques, and results \emph{without} dealing with the practical aspects. The work of the second camp remains unused in reality and oft only reviewed in-passing by other researchers who want to claim their research generates better `results' than that of the other camp members. The second camp's work overall is on an orthogonal path to the work and world of practitioners. The gulf seems wide between these two camps.
