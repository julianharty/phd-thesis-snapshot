\section{The WebView component}~\label{section-webview-component}

(something that's used in a vast number of Android apps in my experience, including eBay, GMail~\footnote{\url{https://www.google.com/appsstatus\#hl=en&v=issue&sid=1&iid=aa75515d184a2423be444d676b7ebf45}}), and many others. The BBC development team wrote a detailed and rich blog post~\url{https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/3533ce9c-393a-43d8-8f44-0c46214c86aa} on their use of WebViews to host their JavaScript based games for several years. The article includes Wardley Mapping diagrams that position their use of analytics amongst other technologies.

Notes, to be expanded:
