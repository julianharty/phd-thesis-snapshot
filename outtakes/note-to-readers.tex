I apologies for any formatting issues of my thesis. I have been endeavouring to address various layout issues that have occurred and have managed to keep the thesis readable and well formatted. However, LaTeX gremlins have crept in from time to time on an ongoing basis and do so at inopportune moments, where the fix is sometimes to revert a change that was made to fix the previous occurrence of a gremlin. The main areas these have happened are in content in the margins, for figures, and for tables. 

I will aim to have a gremlin free edition of this thesis by the time the thesis has been approved.
