Amazon Mobile Analytics is now Amazon Pinpoint

Collect, View and Export App Analytics
Mobile Analytics is now part of Amazon Pinpoint

All the functionality that was previously part Amazon Mobile Analytics is now included in our Amazon Pinpoint service. Just like Mobile Analytics, Pinpoint lets you measure app usage and revenue. In addition, Pinpoint extends this capability by making it easy to run targeted campaigns to drive user engagement in mobile apps. Amazon Pinpoint helps you understand user behavior, define which users to target, determine which messages to send, schedule the best time to deliver the messages, and then track the results of your campaign. If you are a previous Mobile Analytics customer, we encourage you try Amazon Pinpoint.
