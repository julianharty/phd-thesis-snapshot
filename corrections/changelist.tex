\textbf{Guidance to the student}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The RQs need to be revisited and made more focused on the actual research carried out. The terms used in framing the work also need to be clear and defined. These RQs then need to motivated and frame all subsequent chapters. \emph{Addressed in \href{corrections-rqs}{Revision of the Research Questions}}.
    \item Discuss the specific contributions to knowledge that the work makes as these are not really distilled down or presented explicitly.
    \item Give an explanation of the case study and action research methodology and the mechanics of the research methods that were actually implemented at each case study company/project.
    \item Clarify exactly what research was done at each case study and why. For example, exactly who was interviewed at each CS, and how were interviews designed and conducted as well as the data collected analysed and used.
    \item Clarify the data that was collected at each case study and how it was analysed and how it was validated, with illustrative data provided throughout.
    \item More information is needed to clarify the research process i.e., to provide a clear link between the data collected, the findings and the conclusions drawn.
    \item Throughout the thesis thining of material is necessary. Only material directly relevant to the RQs should be included. Only findings with clear evidence should be presented. Remove all informal asides; in particular, reconsider Chapter 2 and Chapter 9. Ensure that the findings and contributions are discussed in relation to the literature in Chapter 9.
    \item Review the consistency and rigour of the language and terminology used throughout; for example the discussion of the software process throughout.
    \item Provide a rationale for the fishbone diagrams and fully explain the basis of the themes.
    \item Provide more specific information on the literature review method used; for example, specific search criteria, tags and keywords.
    \item Carefully distinguish between what the data is providing evidence of, what the literature is saying and the informal views/experiences of the author.
    \item Provide more detail in the Appendices of the data and the data analysis done in relation to the RQs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Revision of the Research Questions}~\label{corrections-rqs}
\emph{``The RQs need to be revisited and made more focused on the actual research carried out. The terms used in framing the work also need to be clear and defined. These RQs then need to motivated and frame all subsequent chapters.''}

\subsection{Focus the RQs on the actual research carried out}
The Research Questions are in \secref{section-research-questions}

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=Revisions to the Research Questions]
At the viva:
\begin{quote}
  \emph{How can applying analytics improve software development and software testing for mobile apps in practice?}
\end{quote} 
Revised to:
\begin{quote}
  \emph{How can applying mobile analytics in software development practice improve the reliability of mobile apps?}
\end{quote}
\end{kaobox}


%I believe the research covered ways and effects  of using \emph{mobile} analytics to improve software development and the resulting artefacts.

%TBC Focus areas...

%The research also touches on \textbf{software testing} mainly in terms of prior art and in practices of the development teams. Automated tests were developed during the Commercial, \myindex{C1}, app-centric case study to reproduce a major crash that caused a spike in the crash rate and they measured the improvement in the crash rate using mobile analytics when the underlying fix was released. Mobile Analytics complemented automated tests and interactive testing by providing objective measurements of the stability of the apps. The research did not encompass many improvements in software testing practices, nonetheless it identified that Google uses usage analytics to determine which locales to use in their automated `robo'\index{Robo} testing as part of providing pre-launch reports.


\subsection{Clearly define the terms used in framing the work}
Terms to define:\sidenote{Most of this list has been integrated into the Introduction now (\nth{18} Feb 2023). The item on quality hasn't TBD where it'd be useful - probably in the related work chapter.}  
{\tiny
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applying mobile analytics: the use of mobile analytics in order to effect improvements to the practices and the artefacts. Applying mobile analytics refers to both collecting data from the usage of the app and also making use of the analysis of this data to identify and address issues that can improve the app. Improvement of the app focuses on increasing the stability/reliability by reducing ANRs, crashes, and through improving how the app handles various errors (typically reported through Exceptions).
    \item Mobile analytics: Analytics where the data is collected by software running on mobile smartphone-based devices pertaining to the app's qualities-in-use. This research focused on analytics collected pertaining to the stability of the app, where stability includes the reliability of the app.
    \item Software testing: Note I need to also add index entries for software testing. Decide if it's to be Testing->Software in the index.
    \item Software development: which includes tasks performed by the software developers such as bug reporting and bug tracking.  Use of Scrum development practices, following recommendations and guides that include application compatibility, UI guidelines, and designing for performance and responsiveness, \emph{etc}. [Software] testing~\sidecite[][pp.398 - 399]{wasserman2010_software_engineering_issues_for_mobile_app_devt}.~\sidenote{This short paper skims over topics without evidence developers actually do them. Their survey, cited in this paper isn't available so appears to have not actually been published.}
    \item In practice: the key scope of measurement focuses on the efficacy in real-world projects.
    \item Exception(s): TBC
    \item Quality: the literature does not align, \emph{e.g.}, \emph{``reliability (robustness, connectivity, stability), quality (usability, installability)''}\cite[p.399]{wasserman2010_software_engineering_issues_for_mobile_app_devt} places stability as one of three contributory qualities to reliability, and limits quality to two sub-qualities.         
\end{itemize}
}


\subsection{Changes in the thesis}
The \secref{research-focus-section} now includes a paragraph on connections between the research 
focus and software testing for  mobile apps. The \secref{section-research-questions} includes a more precise main research question and clarification of the terms that comprise it. The six perspectives have been reviewed and 1a and 2a made more percise.

The Introduction chapter was also tidied up and reorganised as part of improving the readability of this chapter.


\section{Specify my research contributions}
\emph{``Discuss the specific contributions to knowledge that the work makes as these are not really distilled down or presented explicitly.''}

\textbf{What did we know before my research? and what do we now know?} - frame using the 3 verticals.

What we knew before my research:


\subsection{My contributions to knowledge}
The research contributes to the understanding of tools and information seldom available to research - of professional app developers, their artefacts, and of professional mobile analytics tools and services. 

\newthought{Processes}: 
My research contributes knowledge on the approaches various app development teams apply when they use mobile analytics including the selection, integration of code and services, and their application of mobile analytics to detect, identify, and address errors and failures reported by mobile analytics. It builds on prior research, for example, on Insight, and confirms their findings. It contributes new knowledge in the adoption platform-level and commercial in-app mobile analytics, including a) usage patterns by development teams ranging from individual  developers, small teams and large,  sharded teams, and b) public opensource projects, hybrid projects that combined private and proprietary practices, through to a development team at a major corporation.

Some of the findings were surprising in terms of the patterns of use and in the efficacy of using mobile analytics to achieve significant improvements.

Development teams who embedded mobile analytics into their ongoing, core practices, were able to achieve highly reliable and stable apps. 

\newthought{Artefacts}: 
The research extended prior art in studies of opensource mobile app codebases, with a focus on the use of the most popular product offering: Firebase Analytics. It also contributes insights from proprietary, commercial codebases and issue tracking artefacts.

\newthought{[Mobile  Analytics] Tools}:
The research identified characteristics of a wide range of mobile analytics tools that serve Android app developers in particular. It also found and  presents a range of flaws found in professionally-developed mobile analytics tools, including several of the most-used mobile analytics offerings.

The research contributes material relevant to professional app developers and to the developers of mobile analytics. Several of the tool development organisations including Amplitude, Google, and Iteratively actively sought insights and updates from my research.

Improvements were identified in all three areas and some of these were implemented during the research. 

Note: In addition to specifying my research contributions add explicit summaries of my contributions that have already been published.


\section{Make the details of the methodology explicit for each case study}
\emph{``Give an explanation of the case study and action research methodology and the mechanics of the research methods that were actually implemented at each case study company/project.''}

Highlight the methodological constructs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Case Studies: Action Research.
    \item Case Studies: Interview-based using semi-structured techniques.
    \item Analysis of source code and issues databases.
\end{itemize}

Chapter 5 includes a summary of the methodology and the mechanics. I'm not sure how to adequately these changes without writing lots of text. Perhaps a couple of paragraphs.

\section{Be specific about my research, including interviews}
\emph{``Clarify exactly what research was done at each case study and why. For example, exactly who was interviewed at each CS, and how were interviews designed and conducted as well as the data collected analysed and used.''}

Revise Chapter \ref{chapter-case-studies-overview} to add these details. Add to tables and to the respective narrative. In the Methods chapter: the questions covered these areas: e.g. access to the tools in order to conduct the research (research activity) and primary data (questions pertaining to their use  of mobile analytics). Methods chapter: corroboration was achieved using at least one of these techniques...

Documented the interview methodology in \secref{{methodology-interviews-topic}}. 



All the app-centric case studies now include the following additional information which has been integrated into the relevant section of Chapter 5:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[Who]
    \item[Interview design]
    \item[Interview conducted]
    \item[Data collected]
    \item[Data analysed]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[Contemporaneous notes] 
        \item[Emails]
        \item[Mobile analytics]
        \item[Issues database]
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Data used]
    \item[Corroboration]
\end{itemize}


\section{Illustrative data}
\emph{``Clarify the data that was collected at each case study and how it was analysed and how it was validated, with illustrative data provided throughout.''}

TBD draw illustrative data from as many case studies as practical.


\section{Traceable threads from data collected to findings and conclusions}
\emph{``More information is needed to clarify the research process i.e., to provide a clear link between the data collected, the findings and the conclusions drawn.''}

To be covered in the new chapter 9 (Discussion) or in the Conclusion chapter - synthesise these are the conclusions I draw with result to the RQs.

\section{Thinning and pruning of the material}

\section{Increasing consistency and rigour}

\section{Swimming with the fishbones [fishbone diagrams]}

\section{Be specific in the literature review method(s) used}
\begin{kaobox}

    I suspect this item is partly because of what I wrote in \secref{rw-tactics-and-topics-for-this-chapter}.
    
    This is an interesting challenge given the protracted journey of my PhD and the interludes, events, etc. How do you suggest I address this retrospectively? Whatever is written is a veneer of what actually happened over the years. To get things started I've started the following sub-section on keyword searches, perhaps they'd be better placed in an appendix though?
\end{kaobox}

The literature review method combined many iterative searches for possible keywords using Google Scholar, IEEE, ACM, and occasionally the Open University's online library search~\sidenote{Marian recommends I resist trying to provide a specious formulae of how to perform online searches for prior work. Doing so is a) not reflective of reality, b) incorrect, c) highly unlikely to discover the identical candidate materials, d) focusing on minutia rather than on the substance of finding, reading, and selecting relevant material which is so much more nuanced than the results of keyword searches online.}. 

Candidate matches were selected based on a combination of reading the abstract, snowballing through papers that cite the particular paper and their relevance to the original search. The search results were also filtered by their publication year to uncover recent related work that might not have been heavily cited yet. In the early years of the research these were stored in Zotero~\sidenote{A paid account was used to ensure there was sufficient storage available and to facilitate sharing of the libraries.} (counts are provided in \ref{tab:zotero-libraries-counts}. In later years the references were primarily stored as part of this PhD thesis project in Overleaf~\sidenote{A paid account was used to facilitate collaboration, and to enable the use of github integration to help preserve the records of the literature that has been reviewed.}, again counts are in \ref{tab:zotero-libraries-counts}. Allowing for a total margin of 5\% for duplicates and/or irrelevant items at least 2075 unique references, the exact number is unlikely to be material~\sidecite[][pp.146 - 149]{hubbard2014measure}.

There may be a small number of duplicates given the various locations references are stored, and there may be some irrelevant references given the characteristics of working with Zotero (and one of the reasons I stopped using it actively).

Over 100 papers were printed out and hand annotated with analysis and notes on the connections to the research. In addition in the order of 100 personally owned books on related topics were consulted, ranging from those published in the 1970's to those published in 2023.

Generally prior work was read and their bibliography was checked, in turn, using snowballing until no new relevant information was found. As a concrete example, one of the papers returned in the search results was \href{https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17913946012612049501&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en}{\emph{``Software engineering process models for mobile app development: A systematic literature review''}}. one paper in the next 40 search results that had cited that paper extended that topic~\sidecite{martinez2020_an_agile_based_integrated_framework_for_mobile_app_devt_considering_ilities}. This seemed potentially interesting but petered-out into their own set of quality attributes, they termed -ilities, that lacked performance or reliability which they then tested through a small mobile app project created by three students. So this paper did not build materially on the research I was interested in. Nonetheless at least four of the other references in the bibliography in this paper were checked in case they contained relevant research.

\end{table}


Literature searches were performed on an ongoing basis throughout the research.

\subsection{Keyword searches}

\newthought{Software Development Practices for Mobile Apps}

\verb|software development practices mobile apps| and the same search terms since 2019.

\verb|android exception better OR handler| given the specific and consistent use of exceptions as a concept, and as a language construct in Java and Kotlin and Android's origins in Java, research into how others have implemented exception handlers or improved (made better) exceptions are both relevant. None of the following searches returned any similar research for the iOS platform \verb|ios error handling|, \verb|ios error handling design|, and \verb|ios error better OR handler|. Error is a key term in Swift development \url{https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html} Apple recommends Swift for iOS app development~\url{https://developer.apple.com/swift/} and more developers used Swift (4.91\%) than Objective-C (2.39\%) according to the StackOverflow 2022 Survey~\url{https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/\#technology-most-popular-technologies} \sidenote{Additional error reporting can be recorded by mobile analytics such as by Sentry.io \url{https://sentry.io/for/swift/}.}

% Trustworthy sources to demonstrate the relevance of Swift, etc. are hard to find. Here's some lower-grade ones in the interim:

\section{Distinguishing sources: data|literature|author's industry perspective}


\section{In appendices, provide more details of the data and data analysis done in relation to the RQs}


\section{Additional Improvements to the thesis}
There are numerous minor opportunities to improve the thesis in terms of readability. These include copy-editing of the contents, tidying up loose-ends, replacing poor-quality figures with clearer ones, and using side-citations wherever practical (some \verb+\cite{}+'s were left in the thesis unnecessarily. I'd also like to add epigraphs to the chapters that lack them.

The examiners also indicated they would appreciate a list of my publications related to the research contained in my thesis,  so I suggest I reinstate this list.
