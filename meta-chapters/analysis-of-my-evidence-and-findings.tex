        \texttt{="Processes ("&COUNTA(D5:D1000)&")"}  & Adds counts to column headers \\
        \texttt{=(COUNTUNIQUE(arrayformula(TRIM(split(ProcessThemes,",")))))-1} & Counts the unique tags used in a named range (a column - the header preamble) \\ 
        \texttt{=COUNTIF(E5:E156, "*improve_engineering_practices*")} & A crude version of the formulae to check my matches seem sane. \\
        \texttt{=(arrayformula(TRIM(split(ProcessThemes,","))))} & Copies the contents of a named range, splits multiple terms separated by commas, and trims the results. This creates a 2D set of results, processed by the following: \\
        \texttt{=sort(filter(ARRAYFORMULA(UNIQUE(FLATTEN(A2:E113))),ARRAYFORMULA(UNIQUE(FLATTEN(A2:E113))<>"")))} & Collapses the 2D matrix into a single unique set of items, i.e. removes duplicate entries wherever they are found in the 2D area. \\
        \texttt{=COUNTIF($A$2:$D$113, G3)} & Counts items that match the cell G3 (which is taken from a unique list generated earler). \\
