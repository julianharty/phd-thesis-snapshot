\section{Meta-chapter: Introduction}
This chapter is temporary and here in order to help me complete the thesis successfully. The~\href{section_inventories}{Inventories} section tracks the materials I've created to date and identify which fit, where in the thesis. The~\href{section_read_thread}{Red Thread} aims to identify the essential narrative of this thesis from start to finish. The~\href{section_thesis_project_plan}{Thesis project plan} has some notes at this stage, and~\href{meta-chapter-actions}{Actions} indicates how I'm tracking my TODOs in the source of the thesis.
