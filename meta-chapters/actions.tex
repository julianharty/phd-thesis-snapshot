\section{Actions}
\label{meta-chapter-actions}
This is my global combination of stuff I know I want to do and next steps.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add all the planned chapters with at least 1 - 2 pages of content to cover the purpose of the chapter. Approx 8 paragraphs according to Arosha would be good.
    \item Incorporate raw material from my papers to date. For instance, figures, revised tables, key findings, \emph{etc.}
    \item Work on the Discussion and also the Introduction.
    \item Devise my test plan for the test apps (zipternet, android-crash-dummy, etc.). \emph{In progress 24-May-2020, see} \url{https://joedocs.com/julianharty/evaluating-gpc-reports} \emph{for my research on evaluating Google Play Console reports.}
    \item Work on my Related Works chapter.
    \item (Done) Fix as many warnings as practical. \emph{24-May-2020 0 warnings apart from the word count (see comment in latex in this file} \texttt{actions.tex}. 
    \item Clean up and make my references coherent and complete.
    \item \akb{style point - the voice of the text jumps around from talking about 'the research' to 'my research', addressing the reader directly to the third person, etc.  Need to stick to a consistent style.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Done: Abstract, Background Chapter(s)
        \item Next: Introduction, Research Questions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Review all the text that appears in the ToC LoF, LoT, etc. to make the document structure clear and professional. See~\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/296759/footnote-in-caption} for an example of creating short labels for captions.
    \item Revisit my rejected papers (and the accepted ones) for snippets and evidence worth incorporating in this thesis. For example, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/4666349717jtgjwrkchfkh}{Testing Veracity and Fidelity of Software Analytics}
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Using MoSCoW for TODOs}
I discovered that TODO's in the material are not sufficiently precise to enable me to work out the differences between what I \textbf{M}ust do, what I \textbf{S}hould do, what I \textbf{C}ould do, and what I \textbf{W}on't do as part of this thesis. The various items are identified in Table \ref{tab:moscow_for_todos}:

\begin{table}[htbp!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
       Identifier         &Action by end of thesis \\
       \hline
       \texttt{MUST-DO}   &Must Do  \\
       \texttt{SHOULD-DO} &Should Do \\
       \texttt{COULD-DO}  &Could Do \\
       \texttt{WONT-DO}   &Won't do as part of this thesis, possibly will do subsequently. \\
