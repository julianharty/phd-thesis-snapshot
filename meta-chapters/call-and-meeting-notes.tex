In person working session with Joe Reeve 10 Sept 2021

We ran through the two case studies he was involved with (Kiwix and Catrobat). He emailed me our joint notes.

Notes from call with Marian Petre 10 Sept 2021
40 mins 13:35 - 14:15 ish.
 
heartbeat of android vitals

What's clear is my case studies are deep and immersive rather than case studies that ask developers questions in a survey. Also the very nature of what I'm working with means the case studies are opportunistic. I had this much access and no more... This is design I used, because…

It's vital to be very clear about what I've done AND DIDN’T DO, the data I gathered and how, the methods , I NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I DID, WHEN, AND WHY.

For immersive case studies, there’s a risk of bias - explain how I worked to reduce the risk and/or effects of bias e.g. by interviewing developers of other apps.

By documenting the case studies, their methods and data, it's easier to show how the case studies compare and to be able to justify why I can compare them.

Needs explicit audit trail. What was missing is the coherence across the case studies. Help Marian to know where to look for the methodology.

Same order of sections, with the same name, per case study wherever this applies, however don't use a rigid structure blindly.

Given the dimensions and characteristics of the case studies we're also able also to comment on the aggregate.


Accumulate lessons per case study.
Independent data that leads to the same conclusion
Collegation and/or Triangulation.

Being aware of the potential for bias.
Look for opportunities to discover contradictions as a corroboration. 
Some contradictions lead to insights.

Notes from call with Arosha 10 Sept 2021
40 mins or so on Skype.

We discussed tactics based on my earlier discussion with Marian and agreed on me working on the case studies and identifying common threads that can help feed the methodology chapter, etc. Arosha will skim through the related works chapter before next Wednesday's meeting and triage the content: must keep, needs serious work or removal, the rest.

I've created a vignettes folder where I'll have a go at adding some small additional examples from external projects, etc. that help amplify the work in the core of the case studies. These are likely to end up in the discussion chapter. The first example will be ObjectBox issue 605. They may need to be sidebars and include some brief context setting together with an explanation of their connection to the rest of my research.

Yijun Sun 12 Sept 2021 16:00 - 
brief on what I'm working on.

SE in practice, Mark Harman co-chair ICSE 2022 - be useful to look at previously accepted papers to help find the methodology. I'll sample 5+ papers from 2021
- Case studies is one type of empirical studies
- Logging is also empirical (second hand) 
Change the name to empirical studies as the umbrella term, then I can use case-study as the default primary research method for the case studies.
- Experimental case studies were sometimes necessary and can fit into empirical studies. 

How did I find out all the prerequisites were essential contributing factors. 
The framework is a very strong contribution and may be a good contribution to the theory. 
Use the thesis order to re-order the red thread and to decide what to migrate. The MVP. Try to set deadlines for the whole thesis and each chapter. The main problem currently is fragmentation of the thesis.

I need a systematic approach to the entire thesis e.g. for grouping and separating content. 

Input, process, output (c.f. minimise couplings between software modules).
Consider removing 2/3rds of the content. It's currently very hard for Yijun to tell what can be cut.

Highlight the takeaway message, how it's been formed and how to evaluate the takeaways.

Balance the evidence with the claims of evidence.

Try creating a slide per important message - sufficient for a short 5 to 10 minute presentation. Anything extraneous shouldn't be in the thesis. <= 7 bullets per slide. So sim for at most 30 or so bullets in total. Aim to show the main idea and the main process in the presentation for the viva.

Present the slides in the order the ideas are developed and presented in the thesis. We can then discuss what's missing and what's extraneous. Need to consider the bandwidth of the examiners. I can also work on this presentation with Isabel.
