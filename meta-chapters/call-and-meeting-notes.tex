What's clear is my case studies are deep and immersive rather than case studies that ask developers questions in a sruvey. Also the very nature of what I'm working with means the case studies are opportunistic. I had this much access and no more... This is design I used, because…

It's vital to be very clear about what I've done AND DIDN’T DO, the data I gathered and how, the methods , I NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I DID, WHEN, AND WHY.

For immersive case studies, there’s a risk of bias - explain how I worked to reduce the risk and/or effects of bias e.g. by interviewing developers of other apps.

By documenting the case studies, their methods and data, it's easier to show how the case studies compare and to be able to justify why I can compare them.

Needs explicit audit trail. What was missing is the coherence across the case studies. Help Marian to know where to look for the methodology.

Same order of sections, with the same name, per case study wherever this applies, however don't use a rigid structure blindly.

Given the dimensions and characteristics of the case studies we're also able also to comment on the aggregate.


Accumulate lessons per case study.
Independent data that leads to the same conclusion
Collegation and/or Triangulation.

Being aware of the potential for bias.
Look for opportunities to discover contradictions as a corroboration. 
Some contradictions lead to insights.
