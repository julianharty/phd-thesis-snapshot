Call notes with Marian Petre
Findings:
Red Thread: Scandinavian Weaving: Narrative spine of the thesis.

Framing of the problem needs to go at the beginning. 

What did I need to know... What was I seeking, what did I not know - characterise the gap. In other words: Here's the problem - Introduction. What I wanted to find out, this is what I did to find it out and the choices I made.

Her recommended approach, do the following, in order: 
Question, evidence, method, 

Tell the story of discovery from identifying the research problem through the discovery of method, results, iterations, etc.

The red thread chapter pulls into focus my contributions. Probably better placed late in the thesis. 

Situate the opening chapters in the literature.

Actions: Julian to complete the two inventories (See inventories.tex)
