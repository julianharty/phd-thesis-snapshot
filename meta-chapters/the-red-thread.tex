\epigraph{{An effective \textcolor{red}{red}} thread stop examiners from seeing `red'}{Anon (1964--on)}

A `red thread'~\footnotemark 
includes the core message of the thesis that's intended to keep the reader on track throughout the thesis. Here it's being used primarily to help me keep my work on message and enable me to discard topics and material that are too far removed from the red thread. This chapter is not written for publication, however some of the contents may be incorporated into the overall thesis.

\footnotetext{The term red thread is used in Scandinavian schools according to \href{https://writingcooperative.com/red-thread-and-other-writing-guidelines-4910b0d0d395}{‘Red Thread’ and Other Writing Guidelines}. An example of applying a red thread to a thesis is provided in \href{https://patthomson.net/2018/04/02/thesis-knowhow-how-the-contribution-can-create-coherence/}{thesis knowhow – “the contribution” can create coherence}. Tips on applying a red thread to improve a thesis are provided by a highly experienced PhD examiner in \href{https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1192531751949737986.html}{Thread}. Others use a different colour, e.g. a \href{https://phdinahundredsteps.com/2015/05/26/spinning-the-golden-thread-that-can-sew-your-phd-together/}{a golden thread that can sew a PhD together}, and it may simply be a thread as follows: \href{https://www.thephdproofreaders.com/structure-a-phd/how-to-find-the-thread-that-runs-through-your-phd-thesis/}{How to find the thread that runs through your PhD thesis}.}

A key maxim for me is to: \emph{Always connect software engineering, mobile analytics, with the aim of improving reliability of mobile apps for end users.}

    \caption{The lifecycle of a release and where mobile analytics provides feedback}
    \label{fig:red-thread-for-this-thesis}
\end{figure}

For any given release of a mobile app there are at least three material phases in order for the release to be used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Building the product: which may incorporate practices and tools intended to ship a `quality product'. Some teams also incorporate logging and reporting to help measure the behaviours of the app in use, post release.
    \item The Release: For some projects this may be as simple as uploading a new binary and making it fully available. For others they may incorporate decisions and mechanisms to make each release with the aim of de-risking any undesirable/adverse effects of the new release.
    \item Deployment: Deployment occurs when end users install and start using the release of the app. Both the app store and the end users affect when this occurs. App developers can try to hasten when users install the latest release through various mechanisms, for instance through implementing and mandating users upgrade their current release.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:red-thread-for-this-thesis} illustrates these three phases together with some of the dynamics \emph{e.g.} of rollout and disuse of a release, and of feedback from whatever sources that the development teams can choose to pay attention to and apply. These phases are part of a longer lifespan of the release that includes an often long-term postdelivery period~\citep[pp 156-157]{evans2004_achieving_software_quality_through_teamwork} where users use the release until it is decommissioned or replaced with a subsequent release.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{images/my/mobile-app-life-span-stages.png}
    \caption{Mapping life span stages for a mobile app release in an app store}
    \label{fig:mobile-app-life-span-stages}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:mobile-app-life-span-stages}~\footnote{Source of figure, Google Drive file: \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4B5l1tlpclHdKwY8W00qchiCV2YK5JjJP8TbkRHcjQ/edit}{Mobile app life span stages}.} compares a revised version of the `Life span stages' Figure in~\citep[p.155]{evans2004_achieving_software_quality_through_teamwork} mapped approximately to the three stages first illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:red-thread-for-this-thesis}. Mobile app releases in an app store extend the Delivery which may also overlap either or both the development and the postdelivery life span stages. The overlap with the development stage is because the development is not complete until the app store accepts/approves the release (this may include pre-launch checks, automated testing, and so on depending on the app store). The overlap with deployment happens as releases are often released incrementally initially to a small percentage of the userbase - at least some of the users in that percentage will install the new release, until the percentage has been achieved. Meanwhile at least some of those users will use the app which will then mean the release is operational and may need operational support.


This research found that developers are able to materially improve the stability/reliability~\footnote{For Android Google used the term `stability' when they describe their Android Vitals service which is incorporated into Google Play Console. It effectively measures reliability for two specific types of failure: crashes and ANRs. An overview of Android Vitals is available online from various Google and Android sources including~\citep{android_vitals_overview_2019, android_vitals_best_practices}. HP also used the term `~\href{glossary-stability}{stability}' to measure crashes in mobile apps.}
%
of their mobile apps when they use the results of mobile analytics to assess the stability/reliability, identify groups of failures, triage the failures, and address the ones they decide to action. Where project teams stop paying attention to this process the failure rate increases of their new releases - the apps tend to entropy and failure.

Diligent developers and development teams can materially improve the stability/reliability of their apps through applying good coding, design and architecture patterns. Even these practices do not guarantee the releases will always be trouble-free. By paying ongoing attention to analytics during development, testing, and the rollout of releases flaws can be identified before the release reaches the majority of the userbase and teams can ameliorate the effects of many of the flaws.
\clearpage 


\subsection{When can identified issues be addressed?}
To address issues they need to be identified and a practical improvement determined. The practical improvement may be an outright fix, or a workaround, or an amelioration, etc. The questions for the development team include where and when the improvements can be applied to improve the reliability for the end users of their app.

Some issues can be ameliorated externally to the app, for instance though changes to servers that support API requests from apps, however many need changes to the app in order to be effective.

For apps released as compiled binary files (the vast majority in iOS and Android app stores), improvements are generally made to a subsequent release than the one(s) where the failures have been occurring\footnotemark. And these subsequent releases need to be installed by the user population and used similarly in order to determine whether the improvements were worthwhile. Some users keep older releases and others stop using the app so 100\% rollouts of subsequent releases are not practical. (For apps that only ever had one release then 100\% rollout is \emph{de-facto}.)

\footnotetext{
  There are various ways that a binary \emph{can} be patched or updated \textit{in-situ}. Indeed various security attacks are performed using this approach, as, for instance,~\citep{poeplau2014_execute_this_unsafe_android} discussed. Around April 2013 Google changed their policy for Google Play to forbid Android apps from modifying, replacing or updating it's own APK binary code outside Google Play's update mechanism (the policy is still available on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine~\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20130426113437/https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html}{Google Play Developer Program Policies}). In 2019, Google provided developers with an API that developers can embed into their Android app in order to prompt users to update the app using Google Play~\citep{android_in_app_updates}.

\newthought{Would time-machines help?}
If time-machines were available in software development developers might be able to go back in time and repair the current application on the user's mobile device before it was installed on the device. 

Conversely, a time-machine could enable users to return to the time and context when an event such as a failure occurred in order to help the developers understand contributory factors that led up to the failure and the aftermath. 

\newthought{Prior art in time-machines}
\textit{FYI This will be moved to the Related Work chapter}
In 1999, time-machine computing was introduced as a way to help to organise and manage electronic information in computing environments, for instance using a desktop environment - `TimeScape' - that supported time travelling on the computer, and time-casting to restore the context that surrounded the use of a given application~\citep{rekimoto1999_time_machine_computing}. However, that work was limited to a desktop computer environment and has not been maintained. 

\newthought{Breadcrumbs preserve history}
Some mobile analytics libraries include support for breadcrumbs (event records)~\citep[p.683]{MacLean2015_pro_android_5_book}; these breadcrumbs can augment the crash data by providing a recorded history of the events that occurred in the app before the crash happened. The recorded history can help the developers perform \emph{post-hoc} analysis of events that preceded the crash failure. 

\newthought{Record and replay/playback}
Recreate the `journey' (however relevant context may be missing or different and therefore affect the results and conclusions). Various reasons why recreating the journey is desirable e.g. to reproduce failures to help understand their characteristics and causes, to learn indirectly by observing and visualising the journey. \emph{c.f.} heatmapping. Record and replay offers the possibility of moving beyond using breadcrumbs as it is intended to record sufficient information to reproduce the use of an app. However there are various limitations in the tooling, the techniques, and at least as importantly the unacceptability of recording end user sessions on their devices using production releases of apps downloaded from the app store.

\section[Socio-technical aspects]{Socio-technical aspects\\ \small{(Probably cover this topic in the Discussion and the Conclusion.)}}
\buzzwords{Systems Thinking, Games people play}

\emph{Note: the current thesis doesn't have much on this topic. TBD whether to include it, it's certainly pertinent in my view. Tip: don't use the term Game Theory as I'm not going to establish, test, or evaluate the case studies using an actual theory.}

Many developers fail to address all the issues identified through use of mobile analytics and a key influence is their perceived ability to successfully address issues identified by the analytics. Furthermore, these issues are collectively only one of many demands for their time and attention. Human, organisational, and business factors all influence the extent mobile analytics is a) used and b) the results addressed. This research touches on both the mechanics of applying mobile analytics together with the `game' which are the higher-level human nature aspects which affect the application and the value of applying the mechanics. Figure~\ref{fig:the-mechanics-the-game} provides a simple illustration of the game and the mechanics.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/rough-sketches/The-Mechanics-The-Game.jpeg}
    \caption{The Mechanics and The Game of using Mobile Analytics}
    \label{fig:the-mechanics-the-game}
\end{figure}


\newthought{Living with risks} 
Risks include the risks of not using analytics and the risks of using analytics. Risk taking and risk aversion on the part of the developer, the team, the organisation, the app store organisation, and the end user come to play in the game.

Given the ongoing examples of misdeeds and corruptions in the application of data collected from user's activities and user's content - understanding and analysing the \href{glossary_data_dynamics}{[data] dynamics} of the information gathered, processed, and transferred in support of mobile analytics is also pertinent.

\newthought{Effort and rewards}
Significant data is available for minimal effort; paradoxically the lack of effort may lead to some developers underestimating the usefulness of using this data.

Development teams who choose to invest in analytics are able to reap better and more relevant results. Developers can choose to augment platform-level analytics with in-app analytics to augment or supersede aspects of what the platform provides.

\newthought{Risks and choices}
Developers can choose when they will pay attention to the analytics; they can also choose the extent they wish to integrate analytics into their apps. 

There are risks and responsibilities of the effects of collecting data and performing analysis on that data, practices outstrip legislation. It remains possible for sensitive findings to be discovered through the use of mobile analytics, nonetheless the ethical challenges are not unique to mobile analytics~\footnote{Arosha mentioned \href{https://www.orbit-rri.org/}{ORBIT-RRI} and their ~\href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-responsible-technology}{Journal of Responsible Technology}. There are various areas that overlap and potentially align in their concepts, I've not found much relevant concrete material yet, this footnote is a reminder (it is not intended to be part of my thesis.}.

\newthought{Freedom and responsibility}~\label{newthought-freedom-and-responsibility}
Developers often have more freedom in relation to how an app behaves than the users of their apps do. In practice the vast majority of Android apps in Google Play use and collect mobile analytics, the only material choice the users have is whether to use or not use a particular app. Sometimes the freedom is to \emph{not make a decision} (as mentioned earlier). Making a decision may have consequences. Not making a decision may have consequences. 

Who gets to choose may also be influenced by the larger organisation developers belong to. For example, in some large enterprises developers of an individual app may have to use prescribed mobile analytics rather than being able to make an independent [informed] choice.


\newthought{Minimise harm maximise value address material known issues}~\label{newthought-do-no-net-harm}
In the field of doctors there are discussions by \citealt{Schuenemann2011_guidelines2_0_do_no_net_harm} and \citealt{Sokolf6426_2013_first_do_no_harm_revisited} on \emph{do no net harm}. This has been eloquently adapted to \emph{``A competent and caring physician is one who never causes unintentional or unnecessary harm.", Stephen Ross Workman, MD}~\url{https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6426/rr/671112}. Implicitly it could also apply to what users expect from the mobile apps they install and use. So, perhaps a the concept could be extended to the following maxim?: \emph{an app developer not only never causes unintentional or unnecessary harm, they also strive to address whatever harms do affect the users of their apps while also satisfying for other demands}~\footnote{In medicine there have been similar discussions on freedom and responsibility, and in particular on aftercare of what they publish~\citep{rennie1998_freedom_and_responsibility_in_medical_publication}.}.

MUST-DO expand on~\citep{shklovski2014_leakiness_and_creepiness_in_app_space_perceptions_of_privacy_and_mobile_app_use, zhou2017_user_perceived_control_trust_etc_smartphone}.

\textbf{MUST-DO} Explore these themes in the Discussion chapter. Consider separating: 1) those supported by primary evidence in the case studies (a subset of the experiences from the field, some evidence is protected by confidentiality agreements, etc.), 2) those more speculative in nature/based on literature and hence topics for further research.

\section[Practical aspects of using analytics]{Practical aspects of using analytics \\ \small{(Possibly migrate to the Conclusion? else the Discussion?)}}
Analytics providers have a major influence on the efficacy of the application of mobile analytics. There are limitations and flaws in the various tools this research has encountered regardless of their source (\emph{e.g.} in-house proprietary, opensource, free and paid-for commercial proprietary offerings). Nonetheless, flawed offerings are still able to be used to deliver improvements in the mobile apps. Specialised startups such as Iteratively aim to increase the coherence of embedded analytics (those embedded into the apps) while also increasing compliance. HP's AppPulse Mobile provided no-code analytics for mobile apps where their tools automatically instrumented the binary to add the analytics; several providers offered GUI interaction recording and `heatmaps' generated using aggregated recordings of touch screen interactions.

Those who applied the results of mobile analytics were able to increase the stability/reliability of their mobile apps. The amounts of improvements varied based on various factors such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item The starting point for the app.
    \item The amount of ongoing engagement of the development team.
    \item The choices of mobile analytics services and the use of proactive event recording using the related analytics libraries.
    \item The sources and causes of some of the issues being reported - some where far harder to diagnose than others, and several originated outside the actually codebase of the mobile app where it might be impractical to truly fix the source of the issue.
\end{itemize}

\section{Where's my current focus?}
It's in several areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a presentation to sum up the research.
    \item Provide coherence and consistency to the empirical studies. Learn about methodologies applied to empirical studies.
    \item (Ongoing) Some additional development of the possible framework in Section 0.6 and Figure 0.3
    \item (Ongoing) On the related work chapter, adding various references and starting to develop these into coherent discussions of these works, the gaps in research, etc.
    \item (Done) To revise the red-thread for the case studies and create three distinct tables as per my discussion with Marian and then flesh out and organise the case studies.
