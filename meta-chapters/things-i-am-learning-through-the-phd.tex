\chapter{Things I'm learning through the PhD}
Writing the thesis and papers are essential measures of my journey and ultimate completion of a PhD; however they're not likely to be the only, or necessarily most important, measure of my PhD. I've been learning a mix of tools, techniques, and practices.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Latex
    \item R
    \item Kotlin
    \item Research practices, tools, and techniques
    \item Research writing and reading techniques
    \item Critical thinking
    \item Academic collaboration, alignment, cooperation
\end{itemize}{}

\section{Advice from reviewers}
\marian{For the mini-viva: 
Create a clear problem statement to frame it, lots of signposting, and a strong table of contents for the structure. Aim for 20 pages. Show critical depth in the literature review. Use rigour in the methodology, and show the path to the conclusions.}


Articulate RQ's in the introduction to set the frame for the rest of the work.

What I want to know, what I need to do to discover it (approach), what I did.

Big questions and focal q's for what I need to know. Fine to refine the questions as I write.
