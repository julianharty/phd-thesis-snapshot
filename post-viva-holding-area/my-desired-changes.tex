\section{My desired changes}
Here's a summary of various changes I'd like to make to my thesis while also  applying the corrections required by my examiners. As and when I make these changes I also need to record them in the log that will be sent to my examiners together with the corrected thesis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute correctness and relative correctness from p.221 of What is a fault? and why does it matter?\cite{diallo2017_what_is_a_fault_why_does_it_matter} This belongs in my Related Work chapter (3) to augment the prior research in software quality. It also applies to debugging without testing~\cite{ghardallou2016debugging_without_testing} elsewhere in my thesis.
    \item In the RW chapter, in subsection{Mobile app freezes (ANRs)} include: \cite{yang2013testing} they fake long delays to try and identify areas where the calling code could freeze. Their technique is "test amplification". Also consider including~\cite{li2020_experience_or_aging_why_does_android_stop_responding_and_what_can_we_do_about_it} a large-scale opt-in experiment by Xiaomi on ANRs and SNRs.
    \item Add Bishop's work on Software Survival Time to \href{rw-software-quality-including-measurement-topic}{Software quality, including measuring software quality}~\cite{bishop1993variation}.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
