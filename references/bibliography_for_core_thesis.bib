The mobile app should operate all the time bug-free in order to improve user satisfaction and offers great business value to the end user. At the same time, smartphones are full of special features that make testing of apps more challenging. Actually, the quality is a must for successful applications and it cannot be achieved without testing and verification. In this paper, we present the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology and Cucumber framework to automate regression testing of Android apps. Particularly, the proposed methods use the visual programming language for smartphones (Catrobat) as a reference. The Catrobat program scripts communicate via a broadcast mechanism. The objective is to test the broadcast mechanism from different angles and track regression errors as well as specify and diagnose bugs with the help of executable specifications. The results show that the methods are able to effectively reveal deficiencies in the broadcast mechanism, and ensure that the app matches all expectations and needs of end users.},

It seeks to investigate the effect of the key benefits generated from interacting with branded mobile apps on consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions. A self-administrated questionnaire was used to collect the study data. The questionnaire was distributed to 358 participants inside seven major malls in a Middle Eastern country (Jordan). Purposive sample was employed. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 18). Four key findings emerged from the current research. First, the study confirms the existence of four interaction-based benefits in the context of mobile apps, namely: learning benefits, social integrative benefits, personal integrative benefits and hedonic benefits. Second, apart from social integrative benefits, the other three benefits are found to influence consumer satisfaction to varying degrees. Third, with regard to purchase intentions, only learning benefits and hedonic benefits are found to generate that. Finally, the study confirms the relationship between consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions in a mobile context. The study contributes to the literature through adopting the U&G approach as a theoretical base to examine the key benefits that consumers gain when interacting with branded mobile apps."

Given the widespread adoption of Android and the specificities of its development model, the literature has proposed various testing approaches for ensuring that not only functional requirements but also nonfunctional requirements are satisfied. In this paper, we aim at providing a clear overview of the state-of-the-art works around the topic of Android app testing, in an attempt to highlight the main trends, pinpoint the main methodologies applied, and enumerate the challenges faced by the Android testing approaches as well as the directions where the community effort is still needed. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review during which we eventually identified 103 relevant research papers published in leading conferences and journals until 2016. Our thorough examination of the relevant literature has led to several findings and highlighted the challenges that Android testing researchers should strive to address in the future. After that, we further propose a few concrete research directions where testing approaches are needed to solve recurrent issues in app updates, continuous increases of app sizes, as well as the Android ecosystem fragmentation.},

Basic definitions are given first.

The aim is to explicate a set of general concepts, of relevance across a wide range of situations and, therefore, helping communication and cooperation among a number of scientific and technical communities, including ones that are concentrating on particular types of system, of system failures, or of causes of system failures.

In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users' ratings that their apps received.},

    Summary Search-based crash reproduction approaches assist developers during debugging by generating a test case, which reproduces a crash given its stack trace. One of the fundamental steps of this approach is creating objects needed to trigger the crash. One way to overcome this limitation is seeding: using information about the application during the search process. With seeding, the existing usages of classes can be used in the search process to produce realistic sequences of method calls, which create the required objects. In this study, we introduce behavioural model seeding: a new seeding method that learns class usages from both the system under test and existing test cases. Learned usages are then synthesized in a behavioural model (state machine). Then, this model serves to guide the evolutionary process. To assess behavioural model seeding, we evaluate it against test seeding (the state-of-the-art technique for seeding realistic objects) and no seeding (without seeding any class usage). For this evaluation, we use a benchmark of 122 hard-to-reproduce crashes stemming from six open-source projects. Our results indicate that behavioural model seeding outperforms both test seeding and no seeding by a minimum of 6\% without any notable negative impact on efficiency.},

Among numerous categories of mobile Apps, social Apps were one of those with the greatest growth in 2013. Despite abundant research on users’ behavior intention of mobile App usage, few studies have focused on investigating key determinants of users’ continuance intention regarding social Apps. To fill this gap, we integrated customer value perspectives to explore the influential factors in the continuance intention of social App use. Moreover, users’ satisfaction and habit from both the marketing and psychology literature were also incorporated into the research model. A total of 378 valid questionnaires were collected by survey method, and structural equation modeling was employed in the subsequent data analysis. The results indicate that the continuance usage of social Apps is driven by users’ satisfaction, tight connection with others, and hedonic motivation to use the Apps. In addition, full mediation effects of satisfaction and habit were found between perceived usefulness and intention to continue use. These findings extend our understanding of users’ continuance intention in the context of social Apps. Discussion and implications are provided."

    In the mobile-app ecosystem, user ratings of apps (a measure of user perception) are extremely important because they correlate strongly with downloads and hence revenue. A case study examined the relationship between ratings (and the associated review comments) and static-analysis warnings (collected using FindBugs) for 10,000 free-to-download Android apps. Three warning categories - bad practice, internationalization, and performance - were more frequent in low-rated apps and corresponded to the review comment complaints. Thus, these categories were closely related to the user experience. These results suggest that app developers could use static-analysis tools to identify the bugs behind the issues that users complain about, before releasing an app.},

  abstract={Mobile applications (apps) are software developed for use on mobile devices and made available through app stores. App stores are highly competitive markets where developers need to cater to a large number of users spanning multiple countries. This work hypothesizes that there exist country differences in mobile app user behavior and conducts one of the largest surveys to date of app users across the world, in order to identify the precise nature of those differences. The survey investigated user adoption of the app store concept, app needs, and rationale for selecting or abandoning an app. We collected data from more than 15 countries, including USA, China, Japan, Germany, France, Brazil, United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, India, Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, and South Korea. Analysis of data provided by 4,824 participants showed significant differences in app user behaviors across countries, for example users from USA are more likely to download medical apps, users from the United Kingdom and Canada are more likely to be influenced by price, users from Japan and Australia are less likely to rate apps. Analysis of the results revealed new challenges to market-driven software engineering related to packaging requirements, feature space, quality expectations, app store dependency, price sensitivity, and ecosystem effect.},  keywords={consumer behaviour;mobile computing;smart phones;software engineering;market-driven software engineering;medical applications;data analysis;South Korea;South;Mexico;Australia;Spain;Canada;India;Russia;Italy;United Kingdom;Brazil;France;Germany;Japan;China;USA;applications stores;mobile devices;user behavior;mobile application;Mobile communication;Software;Smart phones;Software engineering;Data mining;Educational institutions;Requirements/specifications;market-driven software engineering;mobile application development;user requirements;survey research;app user behavior;software product lines;software ecosystems;Requirements/specifications;market-driven software engineering;mobile application development;user requirements;survey research;app user behavior;software product lines;software ecosystems},

    App Store Analysis studies information about applications obtained from app stores. App stores provide a wealth of information derived from users that would not exist had the applications been distributed via previous software deployment methods. App Store Analysis combines this non-technical information with technical information to learn trends and behaviours within these forms of software repositories. Findings from App Store Analysis have a direct and actionable impact on the software teams that develop software for app stores, and have led to techniques for requirements engineering, release planning, software design, security and testing. This survey describes and compares the areas of research that have been explored thus far, drawing out common aspects, trends and directions future research should take to address open problems and challenges.},

  abstract={In the last decade, modern data analytics technologies have enabled the creation of software analytics tools offering real-time visualization of various aspects related to software development and usage. These tools seem to be particularly attractive for companies doing agile software development. However, the information provided by the available tools is neither aggregated nor connected to higher quality goals. At the same time, assessing and improving the software quality has also been the key targets for the software engineering community, yielding several proposals for standards and software quality models. Integrating such quality models into software analytics tools could close the gap by providing the connection to higher quality goals. This paper aims at understanding whether the integration of quality models into software analytics tools provides understandable, reliable, useful, and relevant information at the right level of detail about the quality of a process or product and whether practitioners intend to use it. Over the course of more than a year, four companies involved in this case study deployed such a tool to assess and improve software quality in several projects. We used standardized measurement instruments to elicit the perception of 22 practitioners regarding their use of the tool. We complemented the findings with debriefing sessions held at the companies. In addition, we discussed challenges and lessons learned with four practitioners leading the use of the tool. The quantitative and qualitative analyses provided positive results, i.e., the practitioners' perception with regard to the tool's understandability, reliability, usefulness, and relevance was positive. Individual statements support the statistical findings, and constructive feedback can be used for future improvements. We conclude that the potential for future adoption of quality models within software analytics tools definitely exists and encourage other practitioners to use the presented seven challenges and seven lessons learned and adopt them in their companies.},

Developers should be able to adopt the requirements of masses of users when deciding what to develop and when to release. They could systematically use explicit and implicit user data in an aggregated form to support requirements decisions.

However, since accelerometer data contains individual characteristics; AAR might raise privacy concerns. Although numerous privacy preservation approaches, such as ”privacy filtering, differential privacy, and inferential privacy”, have been proposed to conceal sensitive information, unfortunately they cannot address the privacy problem associated with AAR. In this paper, we report our efforts to control the use of the AAR while preserving the privacy. To achieve this task, our method leverages a connection to agglomerative information bottleneck, through which the amount of disclosed data can be compressed so that irrelevant private information can be reduced, and a connection to general privacy statistical inference framework, where both of the privacy leakage and utility accuracy are considered as mutual information. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed solution can greatly reduce privacy leakage while maintaining a relative good utility.},

    Context: There has been a rapid growth in the use of data analytics to underpin evidence-based software engineering. However the combination of complex techniques, diverse reporting standards and poorly understood underlying phenomena are causing some concern as to the reliability of studies.

    Objective: Our goal is to provide guidance for producers and consumers of software analytics studies (computational experiments and correlation studies).

    Method: We propose using “bad smells”, i.e., surface indications of deeper problems and popular in the agile software community and consider how they may be manifest in software analytics studies.

    Results: We list 12 “bad smells” in software analytics papers (and show their impact by examples).

    Conclusions: We believe the metaphor of bad smell is a useful device. Therefore we encourage more debate on what contributes to the validity of software analytics studies (so we expect our list will mature over time).

Using an operational profile to guide testing ensures that if testing is terminated and the software is shipped because of schedule constraints, the most-used operations will have received the most testing and the reliability level will be the maximum that is practically achievable for the given test time. For guiding regression testing, it efficiently allocates test cases in accordance with use, so the faults most likely to be found, of those introduced by changes, are the ones that have the most effect on reliability.<>},

   volume={136},
   ISSN={0164-1212},
   DOI={https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2017.10.032},
   abstractNote={All the mainstream programming languages in widespread use for mobile app development provide error handling mechanisms to support the implementation of robust apps. Android apps, in particular, are usually written in the Java programming language. Java includes an exception handling mechanism that allows programs to signal the occurrence of errors by throwing exceptions and to handle these exceptions by catching them. All the Android-specific abstractions, such as activities and asynctasks, can throw exceptions when errors occur. When an app catches the exceptions that it or the libraries upon which it depends throw, it can resume its activity or, at least, fail in a graceful way. On the other hand, uncaught exceptions can lead an app to crash, particularly if they occur within the main thread. Previous work has shown that, in real Android apps available at the Play Store, uncaught exceptions thrown by Android-specific abstractions often cause these apps to fail. This paper presents an empirical study on the relationship between the usage of Android abstractions and uncaught exceptions. Our approach is quantitative and maintenance-centric. We analyzed changes to both normal and exception handling code in 112 versions extracted from 16 software projects covering a number of domains, amounting to more than 3 million LOC. Change impact analysis and exception flow analysis were performed on those versions of the projects. The main finding of this study is that, during the evolution of the analyzed apps, an increase in the use of Android abstractions exhibits a positive and statistically significant correlation with the number of uncaught exception flows. Since uncaught exceptions cause apps to crash, this result suggests that these apps are becoming potentially less robust as a consequence of exception handling misuse. Analysis of multiple versions of these apps revealed that Android developers usually employ abstractions that may throw exceptions without adding the appropriate handlers for these exceptions. This study highlights the need for better testing and verification tools with a focus on exception handling code and for a change of culture in Android development or, at least, in the design of its APIs.},

Through an illustrative study, we explore a more nuanced perspective on what can be considered “log data” and how these types of data can be collected and analysed. A qualitative approach to log data analysis offers researchers new opportunities to situate smartphone use within people’s practices, norms, and routines. This is of relevance both to studies focusing on smartphones as cultural objects in everyday life and studies that use such devices as proxies for social behaviour more generally. We argue that log data, for instance in in-depth interviews, may serve as cues to instigate discussion and reflection as well as act as resources for contextualizing and organizing related empirical material. In the discussion, the advantages of a qualitative perspective for research designs are assessed in relation to issues of validity. Further perspectives on the promises of log data from various devices are proposed.},

    Mobile applications (apps) have been gaining popularity due to the advances in mobile technologies and the large increase in the number of mobile users. Consequently, several app distribution platforms, which provide a new way for developing, downloading, and updating software applications in modern mobile devices, have recently emerged. To better understand the download patterns, popularity trends, and development strategies in this rapidly evolving mobile app ecosystem, we systematically monitored and analyzed four popular third-party Android app marketplaces. Our study focuses on measuring, analyzing, and modeling the app popularity distribution and explores how pricing and revenue strategies affect app popularity and developers’ income.

    Our results indicate that unlike web and peer-to-peer file sharing workloads, the app popularity distribution deviates from commonly observed Zipf-like models. We verify that these deviations can be mainly attributed to a new download pattern, which we refer to as the clustering effect. We validate the existence of this effect by revealing a strong temporal affinity of user downloads to app categories. Based on these observations, we propose a new formal clustering model for the distribution of app downloads and demonstrate that it closely fits measured data. Moreover, we observe that paid apps follow a different popularity distribution than free apps and show how free apps with an ad-based revenue strategy may result in higher financial benefits than paid apps. We believe that this study can be useful to appstore designers for improving content delivery and recommendation systems, as well as to app developers for selecting proper pricing policies to increase their income.},

Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency.Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics.Application: The integrated model and attentional synthesis provides a heuristic framework for further research on complacency and automation bias and design options for mitigating such effects in automated and decision support systems. }

  title={Apps, trackers, privacy, and regulators: A global study of the mobile tracking ecosystem},
  abstract={Third-party services form an integral part of the mobile ecosystem: they ease application development and enable features such as analytics, social network integration, and app monetization through ads. However, aided by the general opacity of mobile systems, such services are also largely invisible to users. This has negative consequences for user privacy as third-party services can potentially track users without their consent, even across multiple applications. Using real-world mobile traffic data gathered by the Lumen Privacy Monitor (Lumen), a privacy enhancing app with the ability to analyze network traffic on mobile devices in user space, we present insights into the mobile advertising and tracking ecosystem and its stakeholders. In this study, we develop automated methods to detect third-party advertising and tracking services at the traffic level. Using this technique we identify 2,121 such services, of which 233 were previously unknown to other popular advertising and tracking blacklists. We then uncover the business relationships between the providers of these services and characterize them by their prevalence in the mobile and Web ecosystem. Our analysis of the privacy policies of the largest advertising and tracking service providers shows that sharing harvested data with subsidiaries and third-party affiliates is the norm. Finally, we seek to identify the services likely to be most impacted by privacy regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy directives.},

Therefore, a crucial, but tedious task for everyone involved in data processing is to verify the quality of their data. We present a system for automating the verification of data quality at scale, which meets the requirements of production use cases. Our system provides a declarative API, which combines common quality constraints with user-defined validation code, and thereby enables 'unit tests' for data. We efficiently execute the resulting constraint validation workload by translating it to aggregation queries on Apache Spark. Our platform supports the incremental validation of data quality on growing datasets, and leverages machine learning, e.g., for enhancing constraint suggestions, for estimating the 'predictability' of a column, and for detecting anomalies in historic data quality time series. We discuss our design decisions, describe the resulting system architecture, and present an experimental evaluation on various datasets.},

  abstract = { 
    In this paper, we examine how the motivations and attitudes of open source software (OSS) developers affect their preference among the three common OSS license types—Strong-Copyleft, Weak-Copyleft, and Non-Copyleft. Despite the importance of the license type and developers to OSS projects, there is little understanding in open source literature of the license choice from a developer's perspective. The results from our empirical study of OSS developers reveal that the intrinsic motivation of challenge (problem solving) is associated with the developers' preference for licenses with moderate restrictions, while the extrinsic motivation of status (through peer recognition) is associated with developers' preference for licenses with least restrictions. We also find that when choosing an OSS license, a developer's attitude toward the software redistribution rights conflicts with his or her attitude toward preserving the social benefits of open source. A major implication of our findings is that OSS managers who want to attract a limited number of highly skilled programmers to their open source project should choose a restrictive OSS license. Similarly, managers of software projects for social programs could attract more developers by choosing a restrictive OSS license.},

  abstract = {Recently, many software organizations have been adopting Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to develop and deliver quality software more frequently and reliably. Whilst an increasing amount of the literature covers different aspects of CD, little is known about the role of software architecture in CD and how an application should be (re-) architected to enable and support CD. We have conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 industrial practitioners from 19 organizations, and a survey of 91 professional software practitioners. Based on a systematic and rigorous analysis of the gathered qualitative and quantitative data, we present a conceptual framework to support the process of (re-) architecting for CD. We provide evidence-based insights about practicing CD within monolithic systems and characterize the principle of “small and independent deployment units” as an alternative to the monoliths. Our framework supplements the architecting process in a CD context through introducing the quality attributes (e.g., resilience) that require more attention and demonstrating the strategies (e.g., prioritizing operations concerns) to design operations-friendly architectures. We discuss the key insights (e.g., monoliths and CD are not intrinsically oxymoronic) gained from our study and draw implications for research and practice.},

  abstract={Smartphone apps create and handle a large variety of ``instance'' data that has to persist across runs, such as the current navigation route, workout results, antivirus settings, or game state. Due to the nature of the smartphone platform, an app can be paused, sent into background, or killed at any time. If the instance data is not saved and restored between runs, in addition to data loss, partially-saved or corrupted data can crash the app upon resume or restart. While smartphone platforms offer API support for data-saving and data-retrieving operations, the use of this API is ad-hoc: left to the programmer, rather than enforced by the compiler. We have observed that several categories of bugs---including data loss, failure to resume/restart or resuming/restarting in the wrong state---are due to incorrect handling of instance data and are easily triggered by just pressing the `Home' or `Back' buttons. To help address this problem, we have constructed a tool chain for Android (the KREfinder static analysis and the KREreproducer input generator) that helps find and reproduce such incorrect handling. We have evaluated our approach by running the static analysis on 324 apps, of which 49 were further analyzed manually. Results indicate that our approach is (i) effective, as it has discovered 49 bugs, including in popular Android apps, and (ii) efficient, completing on average in 61 seconds per app. More generally, our approach helps determine whether an app saves too much or too little state.},

  author={Taylor, Linnet},
  journal={Environment and Planning D: Society and Space},
  abstract={This paper examines the ethical and methodological problems with tracking human mobility using data from mobile phones, focusing on research involving low- and middle-income countries. Such datasets are becoming accessible to an increasingly broad community of researchers and data scientists, with a variety of analytical and policy uses proposed. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in this area of research, then sets out a new analytical framework for such data sources that focuses on three pressing issues: first, interpretation and disciplinary bias; second, the potential risks to data subjects in low- and middle-income countries and possible ethical responses; and third, the likelihood of ‘function creep’ from benign to less benign uses. Using the case study of a data science challenge involving West African mobile phone data, I argue that human mobility is becoming legible in new, more detailed ways, and that this carries with it the dual risk of rendering certain groups invisible and of misinterpreting what is visible. Thus, this emerging ability to track movement in real time offers both the possibility of improved responses to conflict and forced migration, but also unprecedented power to surveil and control unwanted population movement.},

However, it is unclear to what degree stated problems and proposed solutions are relevant to industry. To shed light on this issue, we conducted a literature survey to provide an overview of what current scientific literature considers problems and potential solutions in mobile application testing, and how often proposed solutions were reportedly evaluated in industry. Then we conducted a case study involving six software companies in Estonia to find out which of the problems are considered relevant by professionals, and which of the proposed solutions are considered novel and applicable. In total, we identified 49 potential problems or challenges in the mobile application testing domain and 39 potential solutions, some of which were implemented software tools while others were just theoretical concepts. Although some of the solutions were reportedly applied in practice, in most cases the literature did not give much information on the actual usage in industry of the proposed solutions. The case study revealed that while the relevance of each identified problem was highly variable from one company to another, there are some key problems that are generally considered vital both by research and industry. Regarding solution proposals, it turned out they are often described too much on the conceptual level or are too unrelated to the most urgent test-related problems of our case companies to be of interest to them.",

    Spectrum-based fault localization shortens the test- diagnose-repair cycle by reducing the debugging effort. As a light-weight automated diagnosis technique it can easily be integrated with existing testing schemes. However, as no model of the system is taken into account, its diagnostic accuracy is inherently limited. Using the Siemens Set benchmark, we investigate this diagnostic accuracy as a function of several parameters (such as quality and quantity of the program spectra collected during the execution of the system), some of which directly relate to test design. Our results indicate that the superior performance of a particular similarity coefficient, used to analyze the program spectra, is largely independent of test design. Furthermore, near- optimal diagnostic accuracy (exonerating about 80\% of the blocks of code on average) is already obtained for low-quality error observations and limited numbers of test cases. The influence of the number of test cases is of primary importance for continuous (embedded) processing applications, where only limited observation horizons can be maintained.},

  abstract = {Usability analysis is an important step in software development in order to improve certain aspects of the system. However, it is often a challenge especially when it comes to evaluating applications running on mobile devices because of the restrictions posed by the device and the lack of supporting tools and software available to collect the necessary usability data. This paper proposes a methodology and framework to aid developers in preparing the mobile system for usability analysis. The focus is on the simplification of the developer's task in preparing the system for evaluation and the processing of the collected usability data by automating some of the tasks involved in the process.},

However, much less attention has been directed towards considering how well these tools integrate with current practices. In particular, for software design there is good reason to believe that "opportunistic" design practices are widely employed by software designers, and that few industrial designers use either design methods or CASE tools. In this paper we draw upon some of our own research experiences in a related area to suggest some reasons why this might be so, and to describe some ideas that we are currently exploring to improve our understanding of these reasons. Our conclusion is that the organization and form of the user interface for CASE tools needs to be influenced by the designer's cognitive processes concerning the design, as well as by the need for a consistent form of presentation.},

    The rapid expansion of the Android ecosystem is accompanied by continuing diversification of platforms and devices, resulting in increasing incompatibility issues which damage user experiences and impede app development productivity. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale, longitudinal study of compatibility issues in 62,894 benign apps developed in the past eight years, to understand the symptoms and causes of these issues. We further investigated the incompatibilities that are actually exercised at runtime through the system logs and execution traces of 15,045 apps. Our study revealed that, among others, (1) compatibility issues were prevalent and persistent at both installation and run time, with greater prevalence of run-time incompatibilities, (2) there were no certain Android versions that consistently saw more or less app incompatibilities than others, (3) installation-time incompatibilities were strongly correlated with the minSdkVersion specified in apps, while run-time incompatibilities were most significantly correlated with the underlying platform’s API level, and (4) installation-time incompatibilities were mostly due to apps’ use of architecture-incompatible native libraries, while run-time incompatibilities were mostly due to API changes during SDK evolution. We offered further insights into app incompatibilities, as well as recommendations on dealing with the issues for bother developers and end users of Android apps.},

  abstract={
    Smartphones have become increasingly prevalent and important in our daily lives. To meet users' expectations about the Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile applications (apps), it is essential to obtain a comprehensive understanding of app QoE and identify the critical factors that affect it. However, effectively and systematically studying the QoE of popular mobile apps such as Facebook and YouTube still remains a challenging task, largely due to a lack of a controlled and reproducible measurement methodology, and limited insight into the complex multi-layer dynamics of the system and network stacks.

    In this paper, we propose QoE Doctor, a tool that supports accurate, systematic, and repeatable measurements and analysis of mobile app QoE. QoE Doctor uses UI automation techniques to replay QoE-related user behavior, and measures the user-perceived latency directly from UI changes. To better understand and analyze QoE problems involving complex multi-layer interactions, QoE Doctor supports analysis across the application, transport, network, and cellular radio link layers to help identify the root causes. We implement QoE Doctor on Android, and systematically quantify various factors that impact app QoE, including the cellular radio link layer technology, carrier rate-limiting mechanisms, app design choices and user-side configuration options.},

We surveyed 200 smartphone users to understand the extent to which users are aware of information shared via OSIs and the extent to which this shapes their behavior. Despite familiarity with OSIs, participants misunderstand many aspects of OSIs, and they describe carefully curating and seeking to control their self-presentation via OSIs. Some users further report leveraging OSI-conveyed information for problematic and malicious purposes. Drawing on existing constructs of app dependence (i.e., when users contort their behavior to meet an app's demands) and app enablement (i.e., when apps enable users to engage in behaviors they feel good about), we demonstrate that current OSI design patterns promote app dependence, and we call for a shift toward OSI designs that are more enabling for users.},

    Not only is Android the most widely used mobile operating system, more apps have been released and downloaded for Android than for any other OS. However, quality is an ongoing problem, with many apps being released with faults, sometimes serious faults. Because the structure of mobile app software differs from other types of software, testing is difficult and traditional methods do not work. Thus we need different approaches to test mobile apps. In this paper, we identify challenges in testing Android apps, and categorize common faults according to fault studies. Then, we present a way to apply mutation testing to Android apps. Additionally, this paper presents results from two empirical studies on fault detection effectiveness using open-source Android applications: one for Android mutation testing, and another for four existing Android testing techniques. The studies use naturally occurring faults as well as crowdsourced faults introduced by experienced Android developers. Our results indicate that Android mutation testing is effective at detecting faults.},

    In the online setting, a user continuously releases a time-series that is correlated with his private data, to a service provider to derive some utility. Due to correlations, the continual observation of the time-series puts the user at risk of inference attacks against his private data. To protect the user's privacy, the time-series is randomized prior to its release according to a probabilistic privacy mapping. This mapping should be designed in a way that balances privacy and utility requirements over time. First, we formalize the framework for the design of utility-aware privacy mappings for time-series, under both online and batch models. We introduce two threat models, for which we respectively show that under the log-loss cost function, the information leakage can be modeled by the mutual or directed information between the randomized time-series and the private data. Second, we prove that the design of the privacy mapping can be cast as a convex optimization. We provide a sequential online scheme that allows to design privacy mappings at scale, that accounts for privacy risk from the history of released data and future releases to come. Third, we prove the equivalence of the optimal mappings under the batch and the online models, in the case of a Hidden Markov Model. Evaluations on real-world time-series data show that smart-meter data can be randomized to prevent disaggregation of per-device energy consumption, while maintaining the utility of the randomized series.},

    Software testing is vital, yet expensive and time-consuming. This essential part of the software development process includes testers performing many repeated actions in test execution and management. Use of automation and tools could reduce costs and timescale, while providing consistency by removing human error during repetitive activities. Challenges for successful tools and automation adoption have been identified both in academic research and in industry practice, including technical, managerial, skills-related and usability issues. We set out to investigate what usability improvements would aid successful tool adoption, and discovered that usability, while a necessary attribute, is not sufficient to ensure success, and the belief in usability as a sufficient cure for automation shelfware might be an illusory phenomenon which disguises potential difficulties when using tools longer term. This illusion of usability includes a belief that UI attractiveness is sufficient for tool usability, a belief that testers come from a narrow group of personas, and a belief that skill levels and requirements for tools are static. This may lead to frustration for testers, and therefore reluctance to use tools and automation. We summarise our findings and outline our proposed next research steps.},

  abstract={Mobile apps have become ubiquitous. For app developers, it is a key priority to ensure their apps' correctness and reliability. However, many apps still suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge. Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of real-world app crashes can provide useful insights to guide developers, or help improve testing and analysis tools. However, such studies do not exist - this paper fills this gap. Over a four-month long effort, we have collected 16,245 unique exception traces from 2,486 open-source Android apps, and observed that framework-specific exceptions account for the majority of these crashes. We then extensively investigated the 8,243 framework-specific exceptions (which took six person-months): (1) identifying their characteristics (e.g., manifestation locations, common fault categories), (2) evaluating their manifestation via state-of-the-art bug detection techniques, and (3) reviewing their fixes. Besides the insights they provide, these findings motivate and enable follow-up research on mobile apps, such as bug detection, fault localization and patch generation. In addition, to demonstrate the utility of our findings, we have optimized Stoat, a dynamic testing tool, and implemented ExLocator, an exception localization tool, for Android apps. Stoat is able to quickly uncover three previously-unknown, confirmed/fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator is capable of precisely locating the root causes of identified exceptions in real-world apps. Our substantial dataset is made publicly available to share with and benefit the community.},

    Android apps are prone to crash. This often arises from the misuse of Android framework APIs, making it harder to debug since official Android documentation does not discuss thoroughly potential exceptions.Recently, the program repair community has also started to investigate the possibility to fix crashes automatically. Current results, however, apply to limited example cases. In both scenarios of repair, the main issue is the need for more example data to drive the fix processes due to the high cost in time and effort needed to collect and identify fix examples. We propose in this work a scalable approach, CraftDroid, to mine crash fixes by leveraging a set of 28 thousand carefully reconstructed app lineages from app markets, without the need for the app source code or issue reports. We developed a replicative testing approach that locates fixes among app versions which output different runtime logs with the exact same test inputs. Overall, we have mined 104 relevant crash fixes, further abstracted 17 fine-grained fix templates that are demonstrated to be effective for patching crashed apks. Finally, we release ReCBench, a benchmark consisting of 200 crashed apks and the crash replication scripts, which the community can explore for evaluating generated crash-inducing bug patches.},

    Software Quality is a multidimensional concept for which Reliability is considered as a key attribute. Notwithstanding, due to its conceptual complexity, there is no common agreement on what Software Reliability is, thus different stakeholders use a variety of Software Reliability views. With the aim to improve our understanding of what Software Reliability means for industrial stakeholders as well as that of contributing to enhance the industrial applicability of Software Quality Models we propose approaching Software Reliability analysis by using structural model based on representative International Standards, which are industry-oriented. As analysis method, since interested on stakeholders' vision of Reliability we will apply the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process (FAHP) which is designed to manage human assessment, always characterized by a certain degree of vagueness and subjectivity. The rationality of the proposed model and feasibility of the analysis method is proved by the application on a very large industrial system which provides empirical evidence on the conceptual descriptiveness capturing stakeholders' views and industrial applicability in an efficient manner.},

  abstract={App reviews are important as they contain valuable information for improving the quality of such software systems. To this end, most users providing app reviews expect a response; to the extent that prior research has shown that when developers respond to app reviews these responses improve app ratings and users' satisfaction. However, unfortunately, user reviews largely go unanswered for most apps due to the high prevalence of reviews. This challenge may be addressed by creating a system that automatically generates responses having learned from the responses already posted by developers for a given app. These generated responses may then be modified by developers if required. This work presents a system that recommends socially-acceptable responses based on principles adopted from three domains: information retrieval, social norms and userinterface design. We then evaluate the newly developed system against Google Play's de facto review response system, which requires developers to write responses manually. The evaluation of the two systems involved measuring participants' feedback on three aspects - usability, cognitive load and performance. The goal of the evaluation was to investigate whether users prefer the new system over the existing system. Our outcomes show that there were statistically significant differences between the two systems on all three aspects evaluated, with users preferring the newly proposed system over Google Play's response system. In particular, the proposed system has the potential to reduce the overall workload of developers considerably.},

When Google announces a new release, a whole chain of changes is triggered in cascade, causing many compatibility issues. Objective: This study focus at performing a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the state of apps readiness for new Android releases over time. Method: We performed an empirical study to map apps readiness to different Android versions. We developed a Repository Mining Tool to analyse 8420 open-source repositories, detecting 2118 Android projects and when they were adapted to different Android versions along their lifetimes. Results: Our results show that Android apps have became “less ready” over time. We found that 76.45\% of the analysed apps were ready for Android Lollipop 5.0 (API level 21) release, in October 2014. Though only 5.46\% were ready for Android 10 (API level 29), in September 2019. In addition, our results show that when apps are adapted to an Android version, 59.41\% perform the adaptation until the new Android release month, 95\% are adapted twelve months after the release, and 99.16\% are adapted two years later. Conclusion: Our findings reveal implications that affect not only the Android or mobile development research field and developers, they also reveal implications that points to Google’s policies and Android final users as well.},

To encourage contributions quickly we built contributions into the sessions, we also streamlined IT Support. To help new hires adopt the culture we encouraged help and mentoring within and across cohorts.For fast iterations, we incorporated existing islands of onboarding, involved local technical staff in design and delivery of hands-on training, and applied analytics to help improve the practice. And we launched early to bootstrap our learning and evaluation.Our approach worked; new hires were able to make meaningful contributions within a week and they scored the onboarding programme positively (8.5 NPS).},

Many top software companies adopt agile methods and develop lots of remarkable software products. Although many researchers have studied agile methods using various approaches, whether and how agile methods help developers establish better software is still controversial. In this paper, we study the business data, development, and human resources records provided by Titansoft, a Singapore IT service corporation which is well-known in its successful Agile experiences. From analysis of the data, three primary impacts brought by agile adoption are revealed: (1) A temporary business stagnation; (2) Improvement in product quality; (3) Positive evolution in corporate culture. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the few studies discussing how agile methods influence a software company in software development, business, and corporate culture aspects throughout a relatively long duration (more than 5 years).},

  abstract={With the rapid evolvement of mobile and cloud technology, improving and optimizing business mobile apps' customer experience has unprecedented importance. Mobile developers are expecting a tool that can help them know how customers are interacting with their apps, and how their apps react to the customers' behaviors. If there is any imperfection of the mobile app interface design or bugs being thrown out, they would want to know that as early as possible. This helps a lot to accelerate conversation rate and avoid business losses. There are numerous raw data analytics tools on the market to help those online businesses make improvements, but no tool can tell these businesses why and how their mobile customers are struggling. This paper introduces IBM Tealeaf CxMobile [1], which provides extensive analytics functions and expansive visibilities into the mobile customer experience of native mobile applications. IBM Tealeaf CxMobile is using the Modularization SDK methodology [2], which is essentially encapsulating core function modules into SDKs and centralize the backend reporting. With its unique Native Mobile Replay technology, IBM Tealeaf CxMobile can replay a user's journey through a native iOS or Android app in the way of “what you see is what you get” rather than mere data analysis. This paper will explain the principles of Tealeaf Native Replay and how it works on iOS and Android platforms. We also will give an example of integrating the Geo-Location logging functions into IBM Tealeaf CxMobile.},

Many small and large software development companies invest considerable resources to target available opportunities. As of today, the markets for such devices feature over 850K+ apps for Android and 900K+ for iOS. Availability, cost, functionality, and usability are just some factors that determine the success or lack of success for a given app. Among the other factors, reliability is an important criteria: users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, abandoning some apps in favor of others.

This paper reports a study analyzing how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by 7,097 (free) Android apps relates to applications' lack of success, estimated from user ratings. Results of this study provide important insights into a crucial issue: making heavy use of fault- and change-prone APIs can negatively impact the success of these apps.},

  abstract={
    GUI-based models extracted from Android app execution traces, events, or source code can be extremely useful for challenging tasks such as the generation of scenarios or test cases. However, extracting effective models can be an expensive process. Moreover, existing approaches for automatically deriving GUI-based models are not able to generate scenarios that include events which were not observed in execution (nor event) traces. In this paper, we address these and other major challenges in our novel hybrid approach, coined as MONKEYLAB. Our approach is based on the Record→Mine→Generate→Validate framework, which relies on recording app usages that yield execution (event) traces, mining those event traces and generating execution scenarios using statistical language modeling, static and dynamic analyses, and validating the resulting scenarios using an interactive execution of the app on a real device. The framework aims at mining models capable of generating feasible and fully replayable (i.e., actionable) scenarios reflecting either natural user behavior or uncommon usages (e.g., corner cases) for a given app. We evaluated MONKEYLAB in a case study involving several medium-to-large open-source Android apps. Our results demonstrate that MONKEYLAB is able to mine GUI-based models that can be used to generate actionable execution scenarios for both natural and unnatural sequences of events on Google Nexus 7 tablets.},

  pages={3-13},
  abstract={
    Selecting and prioritizing major device models are critical for mobile app developers to select testbeds and optimize resources such as marketing and quality-assurance resources. The heavily fragmented distribution of Android devices makes it challenging to select a few major device models out of thousands of models available on the market. Currently app developers usually rely on some reported or estimated general market share of device models. However, these estimates can be quite inaccurate, and more problematically, can be irrelevant to the particular app under consideration. To address this issue, we propose PRADA, the first approach to prioritizing Android device models for individual apps, based on mining large-scale usage data. PRADA adapts the concept of operational profiling (popularly used in software reliability engineering) for mobile apps - the usage of an app on a specific device model reflects the importance of that device model for the app. PRADA includes a collaborative filtering technique to predict the usage of an app on different device models, even if the app is entirely new (without its actual usage in the market yet), based on the usage data of a large collection of apps. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of PRADA over two popular app categories, i.e., Game and Media, covering over 3.86 million users and 14,000 device models collected through a leading Android management app in China.},

  abstract={
    We focus on the privacy-utility trade-off encountered by users who wish to disclose some information to an analyst, that is correlated with their private data, in the hope of receiving some utility. We rely on a general privacy statistical inference framework, under which data is transformed before it is disclosed, according to a probabilistic privacy mapping. We show that when the log-loss is introduced in this framework in both the privacy metric and the distortion metric, the privacy leakage and the utility constraint can be reduced to the mutual information between private data and disclosed data, and between non-private data and disclosed data respectively. We justify the relevance and generality of the privacy metric under the log-loss by proving that the inference threat under any bounded cost function can be upperbounded by an explicit function of the mutual information between private data and disclosed data. We then show that the privacy-utility tradeoff under the log-loss can be cast as the non-convex Privacy Funnel optimization, and we leverage its connection to the Information Bottleneck, to provide a greedy algorithm that is locally optimal. We evaluate its performance on the US census dataset. Finally, we characterize the optimal privacy mapping for the Gaussian Privacy Funnel.},

    In this paper we describe a new approach for increasing the reliability of ubiquitous software systems. This is achieved by executing tests at run-time. The individual software components are consequently accompanied by executable tests. We augment this well-known built-in test (BIT) paradigm by combining it with resource-awareness. Starting from the constraints for such resource-aware tests (RATs) we derive their design and describe a number of strategies for executing such tests under resource constraints as well as the necessary middleware. Our approach is especially beneficial to ubiquitous software systems due to their dynamic nature - which prevents a static verification of their reliability - and their inherent resource limitations.},

Hence neither the location nor the number of of faults may be defined in a unique manner; this, in turn, sheds a cloud of uncertainty on such concepts as fault density, and fault forecasting. In this paper, we present a more precise definition of a program fault, that has the following properties: it recognizes that the same incorrect behavior may be remedied in more than one way; it recognizes that removing a fault does not necessarily make the program correct, but may make it less incorrect (in a sense to be defined); it characterizes fault removals that make the program less incorrect, as opposed to fault removals that may remedy one aspect of program behavior at the expense of others; it recognizes that isolating a fault in a program is based on implicit assumptions about the remaining program parts; it identifies instances when a fault may be localized in a program with absolute certainty.},

To support developers in these tasks, we introduce a novel, automated approach called CRASHSCOPE. This tool explores a given Android app using systematic input generation, according to several strategies informed by static and dynamic analyses, with the intrinsic goal of triggering crashes. When a crash is detected, CRASHSCOPE generates an augmented crash report containing screenshots, detailed crash reproduction steps, the captured exception stack trace, and a fully replayable script that automatically reproduces the crash on a target device(s). We evaluated CRASHSCOPE's effectiveness in discovering crashes as compared to five state-of-the-art Android input generation tools on 61 applications. The results demonstrate that CRASHSCOPE performs about as well as current tools for detecting crashes and provides more detailed fault information. Additionally, in a study analyzing eight real-world Android app crashes, we found that CRASHSCOPE's reports are easily readable and allow for reliable reproduction of crashes by presenting more explicit information than human written reports.},

    There has been tremendous growth in the use of mobile devices over the last few years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications for these mobile devices often called as 'apps'. Current estimates indicate that there are hundreds of thousands of mobile app developers. As a result, in recent years, there has been an increasing amount of software engineering research conducted on mobile apps to help such mobile app developers. In this paper, we discuss current and future research trends within the framework of the various stages in the software development life-cycle: requirements (including non-functional), design and development, testing, and maintenance. While there are several non-functional requirements, we focus on the topics of energy and security in our paper, since mobile apps are not necessarily built by large companies that can afford to get experts for solving these two topics. For the same reason we also discuss the monetizing aspects of a mobile app at the end of the paper. For each topic of interest, we first present the recent advances done in these stages and then we present the challenges present in current work, followed by the future opportunities and the risks present in pursuing such research.},

    Testing in companies with highly competitive environments has many opportunities and challenges. Testing is diversified, both contextually and geographically: there are many testing goals, many ongoing parallel projects, many testing phases and all this needs to be managed so that the full view of testing is visible for management and reporting. Testing is also linked to project communication and psychology: communication needs to be constructive, and testers and test leaders should have good interpersonal skills. It really does matter how a failure or test report is formulated.
    In order to localize testing problems in a large software-intensive company, we conducted a current state analysis via web-based questionnaire among experienced testing practitioners, most having at least 5 years experience in these tasks. The scope of the survey was decided to keep broad with the goal of finding future improvements within tool, process and method development. In this paper, we will concentrate on those survey results that have psychological underlying. Based on the results, we suggest a set of improvements for testing and, especially, test reporting. Implementation of these improvements is still underway, but the findings and suggestions provide insight into psychology of testing.

This paper presents RECKON, a framework for mobile app analytics, that provides insights about end-to-end user experience in completing tasks, without explicit effort from the app developers. RECKON identifies and extracts task-level information from an unlabeled data stream of user actions. Based on the extracted information, RECKON outputs various helpful metrics to the developers. We have implemented and evaluated RECKON with a popular travel assistant app with 122, 243 users for 30 days. Our evaluation results validate RECKON's performance in obtaining critical mobile app insights as well as demonstrate its wide applicability for developers.},

This paper describes a principled systems architecture---Encode, Shuffle, Analyze (ESA)---for performing such monitoring with high utility while also protecting user privacy. The ESA design, and its Prochlo implementation, are informed by our practical experiences with an existing, large deployment of privacy-preserving software monitoring.With ESA, the privacy of monitored users' data is guaranteed by its processing in a three-step pipeline. First, the data is encoded to control scope, granularity, and randomness. Second, the encoded data is collected in batches subject to a randomized threshold, and blindly shuffled, to break linkability and to ensure that individual data items get "lost in the crowd" of the batch. Third, the anonymous, shuffled data is analyzed by a specific analysis engine that further prevents statistical inference attacks on analysis results.ESA extends existing best-practice methods for sensitive-data analytics, by using cryptography and statistical techniques to make explicit how data is elided and reduced in precision, how only common-enough, anonymous data is analyzed, and how this is done for only specific, permitted purposes. As a result, ESA remains compatible with the established workflows of traditional database analysis.Strong privacy guarantees, including differential privacy, can be established at each processing step to defend against malice or compromise at one or more of those steps. Prochlo develops new techniques to harden those steps, including the Stash Shuffle, a novel scalable and efficient oblivious-shuffling algorithm based on Intel's SGX, and new applications of cryptographic secret sharing and blinding. We describe ESA and Prochlo, as well as experiments that validate their ability to balance utility and privacy.},

A system based on Time-Machine Computing allows a user to visit the past and the future states of computers. When a user needs to refer to a document that he/she was working on at some other time, he/she can travel in the time dimension and the system restores the computer state at that time. Since the user's activities on the system are automatically archived, the user's daily workspace is seamlessly integrated into the information archive. The combination of spatial information management of the desktop metaphor and time traveling allows a user to organize and archive information without being bothered by folder hierarchies or the file classification problems that are common in today's desktop environments. TMC also provides a mechanism for linking multiple applications and external information sources by exchanging time information. This paper describes the key features of TMC, a time-machine desktop environment called “TimeScape,” and several time-oriented application integration examples.},

Users also tacitly express support for a feature by downloading apps that offer it. Developers may observe this behaviour and respond accordingly by adding popular features, where appropriate, to their own products.

Only a limited number of these have focused on paid apps. As expected, these investigations indicate that tracking is happening to a lesser extent in paid apps, yet there is no conclusive evidence. This paper provides the first large-scale study of paid apps. We analyse top paid apps obtained from four different countries: Australia, Brazil, Germany, and US, and quantify the level of tracking taking place in paid apps in comparison to free apps. Our analysis shows that 60\% of the paid apps are connected to trackers that collect personal information compared to 85\%--95\% in free apps. We further show that approximately 20\% of the paid apps are connected to more than three trackers. With tracking being pervasive in both free and paid apps, we then quantify the aggregated privacy leakages associated with individual users. Using the data of user installed apps of over 300 smartphone users, we show that 50\% of the users are exposed to more than 25 trackers which can result in significant leakages of privacy.},

To address this problem, we introduce an approach to assisting developers to select the proper release opportunity based on the purpose of the update and current condition of the app. Before that, we propose the update interval to characterize release patterns of apps, and find significance of the updates through empirical analysis. We mined the release-history data of 17,820 apps from 33 categories in Google Play, over a period of 105 days. With 41,028 releases identified from these apps, we reveal important characteristics of update intervals and how these factors can influence update effects. We suggest developers to synthetically consider app ranking, rating trend, and update purpose in addition to the timing of releasing an app version. We propose a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to help decide an optimal release opportunity to gain better user adoption.},

  abstract={Software Ecosystems are comprised of a technology platform, business models, internal and external developers, and engaging users. The popularity of smartphones brought along the mobile software ecosystems, such as iOS and Android, which are composed of a platform, a community of users and developers, mobile applications, and online application store, and evangelists that often promote the ecosystem. Given the recent nature of the topic, this paper aims to revisit the state-of-the-art through a systematic literature mapping. We found 63 publications on the topic of mobile software ecosystems that were categorized by year (almost 50\% of the publications are from 2015 and on), by author (a few collaboration clusters were identified), and by the mobile ecosystems characteristics (most publications discuss business or technical aspects) and elements (applications and the platform are the most discussed topics followed by the developers and the users). Our results provide an up-to-date map of the topic for those interested in mobile software ecosystems.}

In this paper, we present the creation of a method for designing mobile application onboarding experiences. We used the minimalist instruction framework to engage twelve university students in an iterative set of design and evaluation activities. Participants interacted with a physical prototype of an educational badging mobile application through a semi-structured exploration and reflection activity, bookended by structured mini-interviews. We found that this method facilitated engagement with participants' meaning-making processes, resulting in useful design insights and the creation of an onboarding task flow. Research opportunities for integrating instructional design and learning approaches in HCI in the context of onboarding are considered.},

However, most software engineering research is performed on large desktop or server-side software applications (e.g., Eclipse and Apache). Unlike the software applications that we typically study, mobile apps are 1) designed to run on devices with limited, but diverse, resources (e.g., limited screen space and touch interfaces with diverse gestures) and 2) distributed through centralized "app stores," where there is a low barrier to entry and heavy competition. Hence, mobile apps may differ from traditionally studied desktop or server side applications, the extent that existing software development "best practices" may not apply to mobile apps. Therefore, we perform an exploratory study, comparing mobile apps to commonly studied large applications and smaller applications along two dimensions: the size of the code base and the time to fix defects. Finally, we discuss the impact of our findings by identifying a set of unique software engineering challenges posed by mobile apps.},

PlayDrone leverages various hacking techniques to circumvent Google's roadblocks for indexing Google Play store content, and makes proprietary application sources available, including source code for over 880,000 free applications. We demonstrate the usefulness of PlayDrone in decompiling and analyzing application content by exploring four previously unaddressed issues: the characterization of Google Play application content at large scale and its evolution over time, library usage in applications and its impact on application portability, duplicative application content in Google Play, and the ineffectiveness of OAuth and related service authentication mechanisms resulting in malicious users being able to easily gain unauthorized access to user data and resources on Amazon Web Services and Facebook.},

Based on over one million Android apps and 320,000 developers from Google Play, we analyzed the Android app ecosystem from different aspects. Our analysis shows that while over half of the developers have released only one app in the market, many of them have released hundreds of apps. We classified developers into different groups based on the number of apps they have released, and compared their characteristics. Specially, we have analyzed the group of aggressive developers who have released more than 50 apps, trying to understand how and why they create so many apps. We also investigated the privacy behaviors of app developers, showing that some developers have a habit of producing apps with low privacy ratings. Our study shows that understanding the behavior of mobile developers can be helpful to not only other app developers, but also to app markets and mobile users.},

  abstract={The continuing expansion of mobile app ecosystems has attracted lots of efforts from the research community. However, although a large number of research studies have focused on analyzing the corpus of mobile apps and app markets, little is known at a comprehensive level on the evolution of mobile app ecosystems. Because the mobile app ecosystem is continuously evolving over time, understanding the dynamics of app ecosystems could provide unique insights that cannot be achieved through studying a single static snapshot. In this paper, we seek to shed light on the dynamics of mobile app ecosystems. Based on 5.3 million app records (with both app metadata and apks) collected from three snapshots of Google Play over more than three years, we conduct the first study on the evolution of app ecosystems from different aspects. Our results suggest that although the overall ecosystem shows promising progress in regard of app popularity, user ratings, permission usage and privacy policy declaration, there still exists a considerable number of unsolved issues including malicious apps, update issues, third-party tracking threats, improper app promotion behaviors, and spamming/malicious developers. Our study shows that understanding the evolution of mobile app ecosystems can help developers make better decision on developing and releasing apps, provide insights for app markets to identifying misbehaviors, and help mobile users to choose desired apps.},

   abstractNote={
     As the mobile platform continues to pervade all aspects of human activity, and mobile applications, or mobile apps for short, on this platform tend to be faulty just like other types of software, there is a growing need for automated testing techniques for mobile apps. Modelbased testing is a popular and important testing approach that operates on a model of an app’s behavior. However, such a model is often not available or of insufficient quality. To address this issue, we present a novel grey-box approach for automatically extracting a model of a given mobile app. In our approach, static analysis extracts the set of events supported by the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the app. Then dynamic crawling reverse-engineers a model of the app, by systematically exercising these events on the running app. We also present a tool implementing this approach for the Android platform. Our empirical evaluation of this tool on several Android apps demonstrates that it can efficiently extract compact yet reasonably comprehensive models of high quality for such apps.},

  abstract={An important category of defects in Android applications are related to poor responsiveness. When the user interface thread performs expensive operations, the application is sluggish and may fail with an “Application Not Responding” error. Poor responsiveness has serious negative consequences for user perception and marketplace success. We propose a systematic technique to uncover and quantify common causes of poor responsiveness in Android software. When test cases are executed against the application GUI, artificial long delays are inserted at typical problematic operations (e.g., at calls that access the network). This test amplification approach may exhibit increased response times for GUI events, which demonstrates the effects of expensive operations on poor responsiveness observed by the user. The proposed approach successfully uncovered 61 responsiveness problems in eight open-source Android applications, due to inappropriate usage of resources such as network, flash storage, on-device database, and bitmaps.},

  abstract={Logging is an essential software practice that is used by developers to debug, diagnose and audit software systems. Despite the advantages of logging, poor logging practices can potentially leak sensitive data. The problem of data leakage is more severe in applications that run on mobile devices, since these devices carry sensitive identification information ranging from physical device identifiers (e.g., IMEI MAC address) to communications network identifiers (e.g., SIM, IP, Bluetooth ID), and application-specific identifiers related to the location and the users' accounts. This preliminary study explores the impact of logging practices on data leakage of such sensitive information. Particularly, we want to investigate whether log-related statements inserted into an application code could lead to data leakage. While studying logging practices in mobile applications is an active research area, to our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the interplay between logging and security in the context of mobile applications for Android. We propose an approach called MobiLogLeak, an approach that identifies log statements in deployed apps that leak sensitive data. MobiLogLeak relies on taint flow analysis. Among 5,000 Android apps that we studied, we found that 200 apps leak sensitive data through logging.},

Strategic logging placement is desired to cover necessary runtime information without incurring unintended consequences (e.g., Performance overhead, trivial logs). However, in current practice, there is a lack of rigorous specifications for developers to govern their logging behaviours. Logging has become an important yet tough decision which mostly depends on the domain knowledge of developers. To reduce the effort on making logging decisions, in this paper, we propose a "learning to log" framework, which aims to provide informative guidance on logging during development. As a proof of concept, we provide the design and implementation of a logging suggestion tool, Log Advisor, which automatically learns the common logging practices on where to log from existing logging instances and further leverages them for actionable suggestions to developers. Specifically, we identify the important factors for determining where to log and extract them as structural features, textual features, and syntactic features. Then, by applying machine learning techniques (e.g., Feature selection and classifier learning) and noise handling techniques, we achieve high accuracy of logging suggestions. We evaluate Log Advisor on two industrial software systems from Microsoft and two open-source software systems from Git Hub (totally 19.1M {LOC} and 100.6K logging statements). The encouraging experimental results, as well as a user study, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our logging suggestion tool. We believe our work can serve as an important first step towards the goal of "learning to log".},

    This month IBM MobileFirst™ Platform Foundation released two new features in an iFix for Operational Analytics, accessibility, and application crash analytics.

    Crash Analytics: Previously you have had the ability to capture crashes, now with Operational Analytics you can analyze your captured application crashes, thus allowing you to better monitor and troubleshoot your applications. We now offer new charts for monitoring application crashes and charts for application troubleshooting on the dashboard of the Operational Analytics Console.

    Crash Analytics has an easy client-side implementation which makes capturing crashes a much simpler task. Rogue crashes are common on apps released to the public. Crash Analytics captures and analyzes rogue crashes and informs the Operational Analytics users. Knowing what causes these rogue crashes gives the developer the opportunity to debug and fix without having to spend the time reproducing the problem. With that being said, Crash Analytics helps your developers save time and betters your app user experience.

    Accessibility: Accessibility features enable people with disabilities, such as restricted mobility and limited vision, to work successfully with IBM MobileFirst™ Platform Foundation.

    The IBM MobileFirst Operational Analytics Console now provides accessibility features.

	This week, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, a US district judge, ruled that while the two companies were locked in litigation Apple could continue to ban Fortnite from its App Store for violating its guidelines. But she also ruled that Apple could not revoke Epic’s right to access its developer ecosystem, harming innocent bystanders. 

	Existing laws do not adequately cover all the complex dynamics and inherent conflicts of interest in corporate-run digital markets, such as Apple’s App Store, Google’s Play Store or Amazon’s Marketplace. As it is, Apple itself plays in its own market as an app developer while operating as judge, jury, executioner and court of last appeal for all others. If Apple does not itself update its App Store to distinguish between those roles and become more flexible and transparent, then it can hardly complain if legislators eventually deploy far more blunt instruments to enforce those changes.

    While we’ve been heads down working on some major upgrades for Answers, we thought it would be the perfect time to look back on how far our team has come. Answers is about to celebrate its first birthday, and in the past year, we’ve reached some incredible milestones and learned a lot about what you need in your analytics solution.

    In early 2014, the same team that built Crashlytics worked on a “Hackweek” project focused on what an analytics product would look like if we decided to build it. With the support of Twitter’s executive team, we formed a small team of six and built what was then called “Insights by Crashlytics.” But 48 hours before “Insights” was slated to launch, we decided to change the name to what you know today as Answers.

    The rest of the journey has been incredible.

    We went from processing 50 billion sessions a month to over five billion sessions every day. In May, Answers was ranked the #2 mobile analytics solution on iOS, and #3 on Android. But that just scratches the surface of where we’ve come from, and where we’re heading. We’re humbled by the support and community that has been built around Answers, and we’re thrilled for the future.

    Amazon’s Fire OS is Amazon’s own version of Android OS. It pretty closely tracks Google’s releases of the OS, so you will find that most Android apps work just fine on it. The main difference is that the Fire OS does not include Google Services app which many of Googles’ service APIs rely on. Instead it includes a variety of Amazon’s libraries and APIs which you get access to. If your app doesn’t depend on Google Service APIs, then you can just submit it to the Amazon App Store; it should work fine on Fire devices. Or you can install it onto your own personal device in the same way you would any Android device.

In this workshop, we will use the Future Workshop approach to develop a research agenda towards an ethical data-centric design of intelligent behaviours. As part of this approach, we will (1) criticise the current mechanisms and infrastructure to frame ethical challenges, (2) fantasise on futures which support user and designer values, and (3) implement a research agenda for the MobileHCI community to emphasise the barriers to tackle. The outcomes of this workshop will foster ethical research and inspire the MobileHCI community.}

We use Segments warehouse service to populate our postgresql DB, then offer public dashboards showing how and where books are being read. So we love that this sdk saves 1000 events while waiting to send them when online. However, that is no longer enough.

  In an upcoming aid project, 1400 tablets containing our app will go out to kids in a super rural part of the Pacific. Every six months, the tablets will be brought together for the purpose of getting new books and collecting analytics. The project needs our app to store up to six months of reading activity; at a minimum of 3 events per tiny book, some kids may blow past the 1000 events. Our event payloads are tiny.

  #1 We are thinking of doing a fork that increases this to 10 * 10,000. Do you see any red flags on that? If you'd rather we submit a PR that makes it configurable, we could do that instead.

  #2 Even during the every-six-months gathering of the tablets, the project would still like to not depend on a rural connection to the internet. They would like to automatically pull the QueueFile off of every machine and store it for later processing. Does that sound feasible? In other words, are there any known barriers to us writing some utility that takes 1400 queue files, then sends each even to Segment, one at a time?}

  title={A Recipe for Responsiveness: Strategies for Improving Performance in Android Applications},
  author={Nilsson, Elin},
  year={2016},
  school = {Umeå University},
  abstract = {Mobile applications are expected to be fast and responsive to user interaction, despite challenges mobile platforms and devices face in terms of limited computational power, battery, memory, etc. Ensuring that applications are performant is however not trivial, as performance bugs are difficult to detect, fix, and verify. In order for mobile applications and devices to appear perfectly responsive to the user, they need to meet a 60 frames per second frame rate, and keep load times preferably between 0-300 ms. Meeting these expectations means that there is no room for performance bugs, so there is a need for improving and developing better testing tools and strategies in order to help mobile developers improve performance in their applications.

  This thesis investigates strategies for testing and improving performance in Android applications by conducting a literary study, and a case study with the Spotify Android application. Some of the key findings of this thesis include promising results from tools that visualise sources of performance bugs in the user interface of applications, as well as proposed strategies and tools aimed to help developers profile and improve performance in their Android applications.},

  relevance_to_phd = {continuous sources for requirements-related information; comparison between explicit and implicit user feedback (like app usage data)},
  abstract = {
    Traditionally, software requirements engineering involved users through workshops, interviews, and observations in the early software development phases. Although beneﬁcial to software teams, these approaches are challenging to carry out continuously and can involve only a limited number of users. In recent years, requirements stakeholders started analyzing explicit user feedback, such as written app reviews, and implicit user feedback like app usage data as continuous sources for requirements-related information. Yet, research highlights that stakeholders rarely use explicit and implicit user feedback in their decision-making process because they receive it in large and unﬁltered amounts, making a manual analysis unfeasible. As user satisfaction is crucial for the success of an app, stakeholders need automated approaches for analyzing user feedback to understand user needs and to guide their decision-making. In an interview study, we found that stakeholders need to know how their apps perform, to eﬃciently identify innovative features, and to understand reported issues and bugs.

    This dissertation introduces requirements intelligence, a framework that continuously collects, preprocesses, ﬁlters, as well as transforms and matches explicit and implicit user feedback to requirements. The framework aims to generate insights for stakeholders in an integrated interactive visualization. The core enablers for requirements intelligence include two main analysis activities on explicit and implicit feedback: Feedback ﬁltering and feedback to requirements analysis. Feedback ﬁltering is the activity that identiﬁes requirements-relevant feedback, such as problem reports, inquiries, and feature requests. Feedback to requirements extracts the software features users discuss and matches them with the features as documented on, e.g., app pages. We developed and empirically evaluated supervised machine learning approaches for both feedback types and activities. Our approaches rely on crowdsourcing studies for training machine learning models and on benchmarking experiments for identifying the optimal machine learning models.

    Based on our requirements intelligence framework, we iteratively developed the prototype feed.ai. We evaluated feed.ai with a total of 15 stakeholders from a major telecommunication company for 12 months. We found that the stakeholders agreed with 92\% of the automated ﬁltering results indicating high accuracy. The stakeholders found requirements intelligence beneﬁcial for departments working with user feedback like customer care, marketing, and technology innovation. In a ﬁnal survey, ten stakeholders anonymously rated feed.ai’s functionality, on average, with 4.1/5 and its usability with 4.3/5. They further reported that feed.ai helped them to reduce 70\% of their time spent on analyzing user feedback, indicating a high eﬀectiveness of our approach.},

    Users are reaching for mobile devices numerous times everyday to use mobile apps. These users shared that peer reviews and ratings significantly affect their app choices. App stability and performance heavily define the user experience and overall satisfaction. Yet this study finds that users are experiencing severe app performance issues regularly. Importantly, apps that exhibit these issues are quickly abandoned after just a few occurrences.
    For companies who create mobile apps, while good performance can lead to app downloads and satisfied users, poor performance will result in quick app abandonment and brand tarnishment.
