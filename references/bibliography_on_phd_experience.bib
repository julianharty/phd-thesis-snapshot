  author={Rosales, Janna and Moloney, Cecilia and Badenhorst, Cecile and Dyer, Jennifer and Murray, Morgan},
  journal={Proceedings of the Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA)},
  abstract = {A key attribute for success in graduate studies is the ability to conduct research and to communicate research effectively. However, many researchers in engineering do not identify as writers, regarding research writing as the end product of a static template. Novice and experienced researchers alike encounter problems common to all writers such as writer’s block and procrastination, and struggle for clarity of thought and brevity of message.
  Conventional, skills-based support for research writing exists at many universities, but an interdisciplinary research team at Memorial University has been investigating more integrative and innovative ways to break down barriers to thinking and writing clearly about research, particularly for engineering graduate students. Using the lens of academic literacies, this paper presents “Thinking Creatively about Research,” a research project that developed and piloted a multi-day, co-curricular workshop for engineering graduate students at Memorial University. Preliminary findings indicate that the workshop pedagogy can transform student perspectives of research and writing.},
