    Many phone vendors use Android as their underlying OS, but often extend it to add new functionality and to make it compatible with their specific phones. When a new version of Android is released, phone vendors need to merge or re-apply their customizations and changes to the new release. This is a difficult and time-consuming process, which often leads to late adoption of new versions. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to understand the nature of changes that phone vendors make, versus changes made in the original development of Android. By investigating the overlap of different changes, we also determine the possibility of having automated support for merging them. We develop a publicly available tool chain, based on a combination of existing tools, to study such changes and their overlap. As a proxy case study, we analyze the changes in the popular community-based variant of Android, LineageOS, and its corresponding Android versions. We investigate and report the common types of changes that occur in practice. Our findings show that 83\% of subsystems modified by LineageOS are also modified in the next release of Android. By taking the nature of overlapping changes into account, we assess the feasibility of having automated tool support to help phone vendors with the Android update problem. Our results show that 56\% of the changes in LineageOS have the potential to be safely automated.

    abstract = {Although there are over 1,900,000 third-party Android apps in the Google Play Store,
    little is understood about how their security and privacy characteristics, such as
    dangerous permission usage and the vulnerabilities they contain, have evolved over
    time. Our research is two-fold: we take quarterly snapshots of the Google Play Store
    over a two-year period to understand how permission usage by apps has changed; and
    we analyse 30,000 apps to understand how their security and privacy characteristics
    have changed over the same two-year period. Extrapolating our findings, we estimate
    that over 35,000 apps in the Google Play Store ask for additional dangerous permissions
    every three months. Our statistically significant observations suggest that free apps
    and popular apps are more likely to ask for additional dangerous permissions when
    they are updated. Worryingly, we discover that Android apps are not getting safer
    as they are updated. In many cases, app updates serve to increase the number of distinct
    vulnerabilities contained within apps, especially for popular apps. We conclude with
    recommendations to stakeholders for improving the security of the Android ecosystem.},

      The research work is interesting in terms of studying how Android apps tended to become more vulnerable and also to put the user's information at risk. They applied the OWASP Mobile Top 10 (from 2014, despite the 2016 list predating the paper being published~\url{https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/}). They also encourage app stores to consider checking for vulnerabilities when apps are uploaded to the app store and the separation of permissions for libraries from those used by the core app. However I've decided the paper isn't sufficiently relevant to include in my thesis currently as:
      - It's dated
      - It doesn't actually answer the update question posed in the title, at least not from the end user's perspective
      - The focus is on security and privacy rather than the use of mobile analytics, or on reliability aspects.
      I may yet decide to include it depending on the focus my final thesis takes.

    Heisenbugs are complex software bugs that alter their behaviour when attempts to isolate them are made. The term heisenbug is a pun on the name of physicist Werner Heisenberg and refers to bugs whose analysis is complicated by the probe effect, an unintended alteration of system behaviour caused by an observer.

    Heisenbugs are most prevalent in concurrent systems, where the interplay of multiple threads running on multi-core processors leads to intricate effects not anticipated by the developer. Faced with a heisenbug, it is the tedious task of the programmer to reproduce the erroneous behaviour and analyse its cause before the bug can be fixed.

    It is exactly in these situations that automated analyses are the most desirable. Model checkers and systematic testing tools, for instance, can automatically reproduce erroneous executions manifesting the bug. The subsequent inspection of the error trace, however, is still a time-consuming process that requires substantial insight. 

    My group developed two approaches to analyse erroneous executions and explain concurrency bugs, attacking the problem from different angles. In both cases, the goal is to allow the programmer to focus on the essence of the bug rather than the specifics of the failed execution. On the one hand, we use data mining to extract explanations from execution logs by juxtaposing successful runs of the program with failed executions. The resulting explanations highlight potentially problematic data dependencies that frequently occur in failing executions. The second approach relies on static analysis and automated reasoning to obtain a slice of an erroneous execution trace that reflects the core of the problem.

    After introducing both approaches, I will discuss their advantages as well as shortcomings, and explain differences regarding soundness and comprehensibility using case studies and empirical results.

When analyzing the version history, such tangled changes will make all changes to all modules appear related, possibly compromising the resulting analyses through noise and bias. In an investigation of five open-source Java projects, we found up to 15\% of all bug fixes to consist of multiple tangled changes. Using a multi-predictor approach to untangle changes, we show that on average at least 16.6\% of all source files are incorrectly associated with bug reports. We recommend better change organization to limit the impact of tangled changes.},

  abstract={
    Real software, the kind working programmers produce by the kLOC to solve real-world problems, tends to be “natural”, like speech or natural language; it tends to be highly repetitive and predictable. Researchers have captured this naturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect in suggestion engines, porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom miners. This suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a good statistical language model is “unnatural” in some sense, and thus possibly suspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large corpus of bug fix commits (ca. 7,139), from 10 different Java projects, and focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic (i.e. unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Ordering files for inspection by their average entropy yields cost-effectiveness scores comparable to popular defect prediction methods. At a finer granularity, focusing on highly entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug finders (PMD, FindBugs) and or- dering warnings from these bug finders using an entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid, simple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for fault-localization and searching for fixes.},
