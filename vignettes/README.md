# README for the vignettes folder

This folder contains vignettes - small additional examples from external projects, etc. that help amplify the work in the core of the case studies. These are likely to end up in the discussion chapter.  They may need to be sidebars and include some brief context setting together with an explanation of their connection to the rest of my research.
