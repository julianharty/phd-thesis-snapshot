\section{Field Reports from Commercial App Developers}~\label{section-field-reports-case-studies}
The research includes field reports from developers of three distinct commercial Android apps:~\href{study-moonpig}{\nameref{study-moonpig}}, \href{study-moodspace}{\nameref{study-moodspace}}, and \href{study-localhalo}{\nameref{study-localhalo},}; one from a charitable foundation:~\href{study-greentech-apps}{\nameref{study-greentech-apps}}; and SmartNavi~\href{study-smartnavi}{\nameref{study-smartnavi}}. Each uses mobile analytics in their regular software development practices and at least one interview per project actively develops the software used in the app.

The interviewees agreed to provide their perspectives and experiences of using mobile analytics as part of their software development practices and gave permission for whatever they provided to be freely used and shared. They also obtained their organisation's permission and approval if they were not able to act on behalf of their organisation. With the exception of SmartNavi, their source code was not made available - SmartNavi is an opensource project and the codebase is public on GitHub.com.

Each person was interviewed at least once, either face-to-face or online \textbf{TODO} check interview details for MoodSpace. They also provided at least one set of their analytics reports, one - LocalHalo - provided read access to the two mobile analytics tools they used as part of their development practices.

Figure~\ref{fig:six-perspectives-developer-interviews} indicates which of the six perspectives these interviews contribute to. The main perspective is, unsurprisingly, the developers' perspectives on their uses of mobile analytics, however they also contribute through the source code of the SmartNavi project, and in understanding the status quo of various analytics tools through their experiences and through the access LocalHalo in particular provided to the analytics tools they used.

\section{SmartNavi}~\label{study-smartnavi}
SmartNavi is an unusual opensource project that replaces GPS for navigation when the users are walking. It uses significantly less power than using a true GPS provider 

\begin{itemize}
    \item SmartNavi project website \url{https://smartnavi.app/home}
    \item Google promoted the project as an Android experiment \url{https://experiments.withgoogle.com/smartnavi}
    \item The app was one of the opensource codebases investigated as part of my collaborative research on logging using Google Firebase Analytics.
    \item First interview: Google Hangouts on \nth{28} Jul 2020
\end{itemize}

\newthought{email summary from \nth{28} Jul 2020 for my co-authors of the logging paper}

The project uses crash reporting (to catch, report, and analyse crashes) and mobile analytics (to try to ascertain where users do and don't use the app). In terms of our coding his use mainly focuses on events generated when users interact with his app.
The app is mature (5+ years) and originally had analytics he developed himself using MySQL, etc. to record the events. He did this mainly to learn about the topic, he was a bachelors|masters student at the time.

Over the years he's used Firebase and Google Analytics mainly for tracking the popularity and use of the app's features. One of the key challenges for this app in his estimation is helping users who don't understand GPS, etc. why the app may be relevant to them. It saves battery life because of the ways it tracks movement, and is mainly intended for people moving at walking pace (rather than in high-speed vehicles).

He also uses Firebase tools to perform A/B experiments related to tutorials and their usability and effectiveness.
He spent a lot of time a year or so ago where he actively focused on fixing crashes being reported in Fabric Crashlytics (since superseded by Firebase Crashlytics). The few crashes that remain are ones either too impractical to investigate (e.g. on a few unbranded low-end Android devices he has no access to) or in a third-party library that only occurs again on a few unusual devices.
The app can run in the background and provide GPS services to other apps e.g. to Google Maps. This has some interesting challenges where Android on various devices and in various conditions may suspend some background activities automatically. If analytics could help track how the background activity is working (and when it's no longer running) that might be very helpful to him and enable him to improve the app's behaviours when run in the background.

He's not proactively working on the app currently. He may spend more time on it soon if he perceives there are new users/use cases for the app. Separately to our research I may help find one or two projects that would be motivating for him e.g. related to mapping Tanzania.

He does coach students at his old university in Germany who are studying marketing. They do various practical exercises to help them gain better marketing skills. 

We've agreed that there's little more to be gained from asking more about his current quiescent use of analytics since he only checks the analytics infrequently in Firebase (he checked it while we were talking, previously it was around 8 weeks ago he thought). He is happy for others to collaborate on the project, to use it, etc.

\nth{30} Jul 2020

He's not actively working on the app, usage is currently in decline - he reckons few new users understand the benefits of the app (walking navigation using less battery than apps that use GPS exclusively). He's waiting/hoping for a fresh burst of interest in the app which will catalyse him into working on the app's codebase again.
