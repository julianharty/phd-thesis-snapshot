\subsection{Repeatability}
\textbf{Expand on:} What's hard to repeat (and why), aims to improve and demonstrate repeatability of the practices applied in this research.
\textbf{Absolutely key is what another researcher would do.}

One objective is to make the \emph{post-hoc} analysis repeatable, where others can perform the analysis and obtain similar results; therefore this section explains various patterns of analysis and there are various worked examples provided in the individual case studies.

\subsection{Research ethics for the case studies}
\label{section-research-ethics-for-the-case-studies}
\julian{Clarify what types of case studies: app, tools, both?}

The majority of the case studies presented in this research include other people. It is right and proper to ensure they and their respective organisations are willing to support the research directly - by participating - and/or indirectly - for instance by providing access to systems, tools, bug tracking systems, and so on. Some organisations require non disclosure agreements, and - in practice - they all choose what access to provide to what, to whom, and for how long. 

Engagement and trust need to be established with the people who manage the project and with the people who participate in the case study. Organisations often require approval from one or more senior representatives in the organisation, these may include head of development, and one or more of their legal, marketing, commercial, and risk departments.

For startups, one person may hold multiple roles, for instance in small startup teams they may be the CTO while also being an active developer of the software, \emph{and} the person responsible for operations, support and customer service. This was the case for two of the case studies presented in this research (LocalHalo and Iteratively), and in Moodspace the CTO was also the main developer of the app. In terms of obtaining permission, startups tend to be easy to work with if they agree to support the research as one or two people can quickly decide to support the research and provide access to whatever materials they are willing to share. They may not have time or patience to read or sign formal agreements, however an email summary of any verbal agreement helps to sum up that agreement and provide them the opportunity to confirm, clarify, or reject the contents of the agreement.


\newthought{General ethical considerations in ESSE}

An article jointly written by Singer and Vinson and published in 2002 was one of the first aimed at establishing guidelines and procedures for empirical studies in software engineering. \textbf{TODO complete the following: I addressed these in turn (as follows sub-sections) Relocate my current material into these 4 topics, else put it aside for now.} 

They proposed~\emph{``four core ethical concepts...: informed consent, scientific value, beneficence and confidentiality"}~\citep[p.1178]{singer2002_ethical_issues_in_empirical_studies_of_software_engineering} and they provided various examples of ethical issues in empirical studies of software engineering (\href{glossary-esse}{ESSE}). These four core ethical concepts are still relevant nearly 20 years on.

\newthought{How ethical issues applied to my case studies and why}

The case studies included people working with software together with the software artefacts they created, therefore there were, and are, ethical considerations that apply to these case studies. The considerations include all four of the core ethical concepts mentioned in the previous paragraph.

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item \textbf{Informed consent}: participants and their respective organisations need to give informed consent in the work contained in the respective case study.
    \item \textbf{Scientific value}: the research has to be valid and relevant in order to justify the case study happening.
    \item \textbf{Beneficence}: aim to maximise the overall benefits for all the stakeholders and harm none. This includes the people who participate in the development teams, their organisations (where applicable), and the end users of their mobile app(s). 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For the developers, they had the opportunity to use mobile analytics as they wished (including not using it) which offered them an additional technique and for some new skills.
        \item For the organisations, they had ongoing issues with the stability of their mobile apps and they would be able to benefit by having various stability issues considered and potentially addressed which would improve the stability and therefore the quality of their mobile app(s).
        \item For the end users, they did not contribute any additional information nor did they need to do anything beyond what they chose to do in terms of using and upgrading the respective app on their devices. Improvements in the quality of the app had the potential to improve their user experience when using the app, through the app being more reliable and performant.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality}: protect the confidentiality of participants and also protect the confidentiality of information provided and/or gleaned during the case study unless a) the work is in the public domain, b) permission has been granted to make the information public \textit{e.g.} as part of this research.
\end{itemize}

The case studies also involved development teams and their relationship with their organisation. 
As \citet[p.2]{robinson2019_applying_endosymbiosis_theory_tourism_and_its_young_workers} observe: \emph{``Business, or work, ecosystems are a community of interacting organisations and individuals (or groups) â€“ or the organisms of the commercial world"}. Their research was into the relationships of tourism and its young workers, and the possibility for exploitation in either or both directions. The challenges in their domain may apply to this type of case study based research therefore the research was performed with due consideration of the potential adverse effects for any of the parties involved in the case study.

\newthought{Steps taken to mitigate the relevant ethical issues in the case studies}

For the hackathons the participants were volunteers who were already working on the respective opensource project. They freely volunteered to participate and their contributions in terms of development artefacts were (and are) public. Ethical approval obtained from the Open University for the workshop at the TestFest 2020 Conference in Poland. The ethics approval was requested as the workshop was intended to include personal, voluntary contributions of how the participants thought and felt about the use and efficacy of mobile analytics for software testing of the respective mobile apps. The workshop participants gave express consent for their contributions and any additional artefacts to be made public as part of the research. They were volunteers \textit{who wanted to actively participate in the workshop for their own intrinsic reasons - to learn and practice new skills, concepts, and mobile analytics tools.}

The participants were briefed and gave their permission either individually or on behalf of their organisations to use the material they freely provided. Several have reviewed my research and provided constructive feedback which has been applied. 
Note: It has not always been practical to reach all the participants, for instance some are no longer reachable.
%
Participants are anonymous with a couple of exceptions: 1) when the information is already public, 2) where they were happy to be identified in public as contributors to this research.  

The research did not involve other human subjects (such as the end users), the data is related to apps and how the app was used and how the app performed, humans were not and are not the subject of the research. No PII information was collected by the analytics tools used.

The majority of specific findings in this thesis are for opensource, freely available, apps without any restrictions on sharing the findings of the performance of the apps. 

The commercial project is subject to various professional legal agreements that include confidentiality and intellectual property considerations. Recreated, anonymous examples are used to protect the confidentiality of the the organisation, the development team, the app, and the artefacts.

For the interviews prior consent was requested and freely given. For the smaller organisations the participants were decision makers for the project and able to act on behalf of the project \textit{i.e.}, they did not need any additional approval. For the larger organisations, representatives of the organisation sought and obtained legal approval for the work covered in the respective case study.

Some of the opensource projects that form part of this research received and accepted pull requests from the researcher, these were freely given and freely received and have no known monetary value.

Note: during the case studies I was also a member of three relevant professional bodies: the British Computer Society (BCS), the IEEE, and the ACM, and worked to abide by their respective codes of conduct~\citep{bcs_code_of_conduct_2021, ieee_and_acm_code_1999on}.

\newthought{Beneficence: the need for beneficial relationships}

This research aimed and aims to provide benefit all the participants and for any relationships to be mutually beneficial.

Mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, predation and competition are five types of symbiotic relationship. % ``There are five main symbiotic relationships: mutualism, commensalism, predation, parasitism, and competition."  Symbiosis: The Art of Living Together https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/symbiosis-art-living-together/ 
Of these the last three may produce adverse outcomes for at least one participant.

In computer science research that involves organisations and live projects the type or types of symbiotic relationship(s) are another key consideration. The candidate projects and their organisations need to be confident that if they participate as case studies in research that they will not suffer in the relationship. If they see mutual benefits of the research they may be more willing to actively participate. 




\newthought{Agency of participants and their organisations}

Another consideration is the concept of `agency' that the organisations and the relevant people are free to choose whether they wished to participate in the research. Some candidates declined to participate in the research on behalf of their project or organisation for various reasons. A common reason was lack of time on their part, another was that some candidates perceived the research would not be acceptable to their organisation, for instance owing to confidentiality or business risk.

The participants choose their model of engagement, this means the research needs to be adapted to their engagement model, availability, and ways of working. The researcher may need to bridge between and/or mediate between the academic research ways of working and those practiced in industry, and here in the domain of mobile app development. In particular the researcher needs to uphold the expectations of both academia and industry, this may be easier for someone who has sufficient experience and competence in both ecosysystems.

\newthought{How were these research concepts applied in this research?}

Every one of the actual case studies, and those that did not come to pass, started with a connection between two or more people. Sometimes the connection was indirect via someone who knew of the research. In several cases the relationship was established by someone at the candidate case study who was aware of the researcher and the research. There will be other ways to recruit potential case studies, however they were not used for this research.

However an initial contact/communication came about thumbnail of the research was presented to the candidate. This included an explanation that at least some of the work would need to be permitted to be published as part of the research and that permission would need to be freely given. With the exception of a particular commercial case study the engagement was voluntary and unpaid. The particular commercial case study ran alongside a paid consultancy where the researcher was engaged to help address challenges in one or more projects with similar aims to this research. Details of the organisation, the project(s), and the particular results are constrained by a commercial non-disclosure agreement.

For the two direct engagement case studies for opensource projects, they both asked for help to improve the reliability of at least one of their Android apps. Therefore the engagement had the potential to be mutually beneficial. Similarly, for the case studies with mobile analytics tool/service providers they saw value in being engaged with the research and the immediate results of those case studies. For the developer interviews the symbiotic relationship was closest to being commensal, while they may glean some benefits, it was not a primary factor in their willingness to participate. Instead they were keen and willing to help with the research for the good of the research.
