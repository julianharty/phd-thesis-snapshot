\chapter{On Mobile Analytics}
Mobile Analytics, an umbrella term that encompasses various aspects of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Products and/or Services:
    \item Software libraries:
    \item Data reporting, filtering, collection, propagation, import, storage, analysis, reporting, export
    \item Data use and ownership, data 'protection', privacy, sensitive data, permissions, etc.
    \item Types and extent of data collected, and not collected (which affects the ability to analyse, fault-find, etc.)
    \item The history and movements in the industry might also be relevant and of interest.
\end{itemize}

Include my 3 layers figure. Perhaps the 3 views of quality figure. My data sources figure.

\section{Characteristics of Analytics Tools}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Status and Reporting of problems and outages
    \item Testability
    \item Performance Characteristics (Latency, Volumes,...)
    \item Time (Timezones, Daily Updates, Reporting periods, Data availability,...)
    \item Interoperability with external software e.g. for integration, analysis
    \item Vitality and Popularity: 
    \item Pricing:
    \item TBC
\end{itemize}
