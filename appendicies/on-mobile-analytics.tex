\chapter{On Mobile Analytics}
Mobile Analytics, an umbrella term that encompasses various aspects of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Products and/or Services:
    \item Software libraries:
    \item Data reporting, filtering, collection, propagation, import, storage, analysis, reporting, export
    \item Data use and ownership, data 'protection', privacy, sensitive data, permissions, etc.
    \item Types and extent of data collected, and not collected (which affects the ability to analyse, fault-find, etc.)
    \item The history and movements in the industry might also be relevant and of interest.
\end{itemize}

Include my 3 layers figure. Perhaps the 3 views of quality figure. My data sources figure. 

\section{Layers of an app}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Interface:
    \item The rest of the app:
    \item The platform's perspective of an app:
\end{enumerate}

    \item A Conduit:
    \item Data receiver:
    \item Load, validate, transform:
    \item Data base:
    \item Data processing (e.g. filtering, grouping and aggregation, pattern recognition and matching, etc.)

    \item User Interfaces, including APIs:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Four perspectives on mobile apps}

App stores have established various groups of people, each has a distinct view of the mobile apps in the app store. Broadly, the public (group 1) knows the least, and the app store (group 4) knows the most.

Groups and their perspectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Public}: The public can see information that is publicly available in the app store pertaining to apps. This information includes screenshots, descriptions, popularity, and additional information about particular apps. They may also see rankings, promoted apps, etc.
    \item \textbf{User}: A user has installed an app, they can explore the app and use it. They may form opinions on the usefulness, value and quality of the app. They determine whether they use it, and when. They may stop using it for whatever reason, and may uninstall the app. QoE and UX both pertain to user's and their perspectives of an app.
    \item \textbf{Development team}: The development team own the creation and development of an app. They may also maintain and support it. They may obtain information from various sources pertaining to the use of their app from their app's user-base. They choose what an app reports and to whom in terms of logging recorded by, and analytics sent by, the app.
    \item \textbf{App Store}: The app store has an aggregate perspective of all the apps in their app store (and also apps they have suspended or rejected).
\end{enumerate}

There are many factors that influence why install mobile apps. These include perceived risk, trust, perceived benefit amongst other factors~\cite{harris2016identifying}. Trust, in turn, includes several considerations - whether an app is trustworthy and whether the \emph{`app market has high integrity'}~\cite{harris2016identifying}.

Users don't use all their apps, they use some because they're bored~\cite{pielot2015attention}, and others because they have to or want to. Uses and gratification of mobile apps by people in Jordan~\cite{ALNAWAS2016313}, and in the USA are assessed in detail in~\cite{gerlich2015app}. For apps that are used when people are bored they are easy to abandon, particularly if the quality of the app's performance is poor, for instance 35.18\% of users in~\cite{lim_investigating_country_differences} stated they abandoned apps because of crashes. 

Ongoing use may be longer for some categories of apps such as social apps~\cite{HSIAO2016342}, seasonal \emph{e.g.} Google's Santa Tracker app, periodic \emph{e.g.} a conference app for academic research conferences, and so on. Usage also varies by the type of app, for instance news apps may be used more in mornings, communications apps throughout the day, and games in the evenings~\cite{bohmer2011falling_asleep_with_angry_birds}. There are also differences in the behaviours of users from various countries~\cite{lim_investigating_country_differences}.  
\cite{HSIAO2016342} provides the research framework reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:consumer_value_perspectives_elsevier} ( used with permission)\footnote{RightsLink permission: 4836950640436 obtained 27 May 2020. DOI~\url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2015.08.014}}) to help assess user's intentions to continue using an app.

Uninstalls: TBC see~\cite{bohmer2011falling_asleep_with_angry_birds} in turn cited in~\cite{lim_investigating_country_differences} on uninstalls. % MUST-DO complete this section 27-May-2020.

\end{figure}

Data can be collected by apps, devices, and the app store, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:data_sources_and_views}. Users can see which apps they have installed on their device and may be able to decide whether device analytics is collected. They can also see publicly available information about apps in the app store. Developers can see the same public data in the app store, they can also see additional data Google gathers and provides about \textit{their} apps together with whatever access they have to analytics tools incorporated into these apps.

Note: the third set of observers are the people and organisations who provide the app store and the various tools and products. They have a unique perspective across \textit{all the apps} that use their product. Google, for instance, calculates and publishes app-store wide "Bad behavior thresholds" for crash rates (1.09\%) and ANRs (0.47\%).

    \item Pricing:
    \item TBC
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples of flaws in mobile analytics offerings}
\subsection{Azetone [Heatmaps]}
Some quirks in the system at rest and never been used: as the following extract, in Figure \ref{fig:azetone_dashboard_flaws_for_kiwix_2015}, of a screenshot shows - a brand new account has some quirks that donâ€™t seem correct:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app structure at 0 is 33\% higher than last month
    \item For app structure and profiles set-up there is a bar, but not for the other indicators, which have none.
    \item Spurious percentages: 59\%, 29\% and 12\%
    \item 20 of 50,000 [users] used
\end{itemize}

Comment from their CEO \emph{``FYI, by default our SDKs are reporting back to the servers with a delay which can be up to 15 hours (to minimize bandwidth and resource consumption)."}. However, during my limited evaluation no heatmaps appeared in their dashboard for our project.
