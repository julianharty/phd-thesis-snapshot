Arosha estimates there's about 5 weeks for a typical full-time PhD student to complete the entire thesis as a viable draft. To help me track and motivate myself, here's a countdown of the approximately 200 hours equivalent (5 weeks * 5 days * 8 hours).

The thesis will still need revising which is likely to increase the total work before it's fit to submit.

\begin{enumerate}
    \reverselabel{200}
    \item Work on literature review chapter. Added several papers related to software testing for Android apps. Learning more about applying mutation testing to Android apps.
    \item Added this section and the reverse counter. Read several papers from QRS 2017, selected one of those read - on software reliability as user perception... Interestingly (to me) I spent more time searching, reading, and formatting the references than writing. Let's see how the time's distributed as I continue to make progress.
    \item Worked on filling in missing details for the `my contributions' section. Also spent about 20 mins looking through various ICST 2021 workshops to see if any were worth aiming to submit some of my work to. Some recent non-thesis work on test tools for Android protocol analysis and testing might be a good fit.
    \item Wrote up the PRADA paper in the related works chapter. 
    \item Added a couple more papers with brief notes. Reading these papers so I can write them up. Distracted by the OU admin deciding to close my account prematurely - that took about an hour in addition to my work on my thesis.
    \item Wrote some notes on logging.
    \item Revisiting my paper on improving logging (from 2017) combined with some additional current investigation into what's available and might be particularly relevant for a case study. Discovered some links have long since disappeared e.g. where a business has been acquired. Discussions with Marian and Isabel today.
    \item Spent another hour reading and writing about logging practices. Added several examples from the K-9 Android email client app. I also incorporated a revised introduction from my old draft paper on improving logging.- good to be able to re-purpose and reuse that work!
    \item Watching one of the Twitter Flight 2015 videos on the backend design of Answers, mobile analytics. Also reading up on two of the key algorithms that underpinned their work (Hyper Log Log, and Bloom Filters).
    \item Some non-thesis tidying up of my paper notes, sketches, and printed materials.
    \item Reading some of Li Li's recent papers. Wrote up one of them so far.
    \item Also investigated the project reproduction materials from one of Li Li's papers \url{https://github.com/CraftDroid} and how they might be used for real-world application by commercial developers (\textit{i.e.} beyond the research community).
    \item Read the second of the papers Li Li co-authored for ISSTA 2019. Emailed the lead author as the reproduction package lacks test or installation scripts. Underwhelmed with the paper as it stands, wrote it up nonetheless.
    \item Updated and extended the Iteratively case study. Also wrote two additional paragraphs in the summary for the case studies.
    \item Read up on a unit testing library for log messages and compared it with the \texttt{logAssert} library we wrote. Writing this up now.
    \item Revising the logging case study section and adding various notes to help me remember what to include from my existing research and writing related to this topic.
    \item An extended journey into the sizes of native all development teams, started by~\url{https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1345288831029956610}.
    \item Hour long call with Gergely Orosz ex-Uber, \href{https://www.mobileatscale.com/}{mobileatscale.com}
    \item Wrote some material on dynamics of development teams, requested more info from the source.
    \item Researching and writing notes on developing for Kindle Fire devices and for the Amazon appstore as part of the discussion chapter. Created developer account as part of the process.
    \item Wrote up the first paper in my Zotero database related to my thesis, on automating UX oriented performance testing.
