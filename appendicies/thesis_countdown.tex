Arosha estimates there's about 5 weeks for a typical full-time PhD student to complete the entire thesis as a viable draft. To help me track and motivate myself, here's a countdown of the approximately 200 hours equivalent (5 weeks * 5 days * 8 hours).

The thesis will still need revising which is likely to increase the total work before it's fit to submit.
