Arosha estimates there's about 5 weeks for a typical full-time PhD student to complete the entire thesis as a viable draft. To help me track and motivate myself, here's a countdown of the approximately 200 hours equivalent (5 weeks * 5 days * 8 hours).

The thesis will still need revising which is likely to increase the total work before it's fit to submit.

\begin{enumerate}
    \reverselabel{200}
    \item Work on literature review chapter. Added several papers related to software testing for Android apps. Learning more about applying mutation testing to Android apps.
    \item Added this section and the reverse counter. Read several papers from QRS 2017, selected one of those read - on software reliability as user perception... Interestingly (to me) I spent more time searching, reading, and formatting the references than writing. Let's see how the time's distributed as I continue to make progress.
    \item Worked on filling in missing details for the `my contributions' section. Also spent about 20 mins looking through various ICST 2021 workshops to see if any were worth aiming to submit some of my work to. Some recent non-thesis work on test tools for Android protocol analysis and testing might be a good fit.
    \item Wrote up the PRADA paper in the related works chapter. 
    \item Added a couple more papers with brief notes. Reading these papers so I can write them up. Distracted by the OU admin deciding to close my account prematurely - that took about an hour in addition to my work on my thesis.
