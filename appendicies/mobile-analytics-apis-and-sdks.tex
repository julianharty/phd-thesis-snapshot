\chapter{Mobile Analytics APIs and SDKs}~\label{appendix-maaas}

\julian{An analysis of the various extents of the APIs and SDKs may be of interest to industry and to the research community. Microsoft's App Center is a good place to start, followed by the opensource codebases of Segment, PostHog, Sentry, and Count.ly. For the purposes of this topic, APIs are of the service, any API provided by the SDK would be covered as part of the discussion of the SDK (unless there's good reason to cover it as a distinct topic).}

\julian{Build at least one set of tables, perhaps two. The first set would be per provider, the second could be by area (API vs SDK). Perhaps it'd be wise to store the underlying info outside of latex and then to import it into the tables, \emph{etc.} here.}
