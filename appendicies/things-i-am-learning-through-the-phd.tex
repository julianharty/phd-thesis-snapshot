\chapter{Things I'm learning through the PhD}
Writing the thesis and papers are essential measures of my journey and ultimate completion of a PhD; however they're not likely to be the only, or necessarily most important, measure of my PhD. I've been learning a mix of tools, techniques, and practices.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Latex
    \item R
    \item Kotlin
    \item Research practices, tools, and techniques
    \item Research writing and reading techniques
    \item Critical thinking
    \item Academic collaboration, alignment, cooperation
\end{itemize}{}
