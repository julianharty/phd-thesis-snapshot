\section{An aside on packaging mobile apps}~\label{section-packaging-mobile-apps}
Mobile apps are a bit like snails, who carry everything with them in their shell, well actually in their application binary package (known as an APK~\footnote{Android Package Kit\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package}} file). This includes whichever libraries they use. Therefore, when developers want to include pre-packaged support for crash-reporting and/or mobile analytics, the development team need to incorporate the relevant software libraries in their application binary package. These libraries are therefore distributed as an intrinsic part of an app and installed seamlessly with the main application onto a user's device.
