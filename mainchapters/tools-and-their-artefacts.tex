\section{Some limits of what can be measured}

Here's a placeholder list, the points will need integrating.
\begin{itemize}
    \item React Native runtime - within runtime crashes vs. application crashes. (LocalHalo and Taskinator apps).
    \item Crashes at startup c.f. private correspondence with Google.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pre-launch reports}
The GTAF project uses pre-launch reports (an intrinsic part of Google Play Console), and the pre-launch report includes automated testing of pre-release apps. The crashes reported in pre-launch reports do not necessarily affect end users. Conversely the pre-launch report automated testing does not find all the failures that affect end users. (Dua \& Zikr app).

Why some projects stopped using pre-launch reports: c.f. the Google bug. TODO add link to the issue on Google and add supporting text.
