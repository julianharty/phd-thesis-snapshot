\section{Beacons in Mobile Analytics}
\textit{This is where I'll gather notes on beacons found in mobile analytics outputs. It may eventually be incorporated into my thesis. For now, it's where raw content and ideas will be collected and later collated.}

Inspirations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scott Barber's work on modelling software performance [testing].
\end{itemize}

Candidates for beacons include (numbered for ease of reference):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An aggregate increase in error rate
    \item Early adverse trends during a phased release rollout
    \item Correlations with one to a few predetermined factors (e.g. OS release, device model, ...)
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
