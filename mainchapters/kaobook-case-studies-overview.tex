\chapter{Overview of the case studies}~\label{chapter-case-studies-overview}

This chapter introduces each of the app-centric and tool-centric case studies using a consistent structure to make them easy to comprehend and to facilitate comparison. For each off the app-centric case studies it uses two summary tables to do so. The first presents the key-facts pertaining to that case study, the second table presents the data sources. These are augmented with brief descriptions to provide additional context. Each of the overviews for the tool-centric case studies includes a table with the key-facts augmented with a contextual summary together with the data collected and methods used for collecting material for this mobile analytics tool.

The depth of each section varies to focus on material that's of consequence to the thesis. The findings for the case studies and the additional research are presented in the subsequent three chapters.

The case studies are in three groups, with a couple of interim sections that present complementary research that helps to fill various gaps. These three groups are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item[1] App-centric case studies that \textbf{do not} have interventions (Sections \ref{case-study-overview-gtaf}, to \ref{case-study-overview-smartnavi}).
    \item[2] App-centric case studies that \textbf{do} have interventions (Sections \ref{case-study-overview-kiwix} to \ref{case-study-overview-C1}).
    \item[ ] Interim work on various field experiments (Section \ref{section-field-experiments-to-augment-app-centric-case-studies}) and source code analysis (Section \ref{section-sourcecode-analysis-to-augment-app-centric-case-studies}).
    \item[3] Tool-centric case studies (Sections \ref{case-study-overview-crashlytics} to \ref{case-study-overview-sentry}).
    \item[ ] Section \ref{section-case-study-misc-contributions} briefly introduces six more mobile analytics tools and another Android app as these provide miscellaneous minor contributions in the subsequent three chapters.
\end{enumerate}

The app-centric case studies are presented in the same order as Table~\ref{tab:app-centric-studies-research-perspective} for the app-centric cases and then Table~\ref{tab:tool-centric-studies-research-perspective} for the tool-centric cases.

    \item \textbf{Organisation overview:} including an overview of the development team and practices.
    \item \textbf{Engagement:} my involvement and the timescales.
    \item \textbf{Data/methods:} a summary of the data collected and methods used for the data collection based on Table~\ref{tab:mapping-datasources-to-six-perspectives}, including any intervention.
    \item \textbf{Contributions to the research} and where they are located in the rest of this dissertation.

\section{App-centric: GTAF}~\label{case-study-overview-gtaf}
% A couple of sentences to introduce them
\Acrfull{gtaf}\index{GTAF} is a UK-based charity that provides Islamic apps free of charge and without in-app advertising. The project started in 2016 with the aim of enabling people to learn the Quran in the local language -- Bangla -- in Bangladesh. The project was started by a self-taught Android developer and his cousin Yemin, at the time an undergraduate student in computer science, who is now employed by the project in a hybrid role of software developer and project manager. Table \ref{tab:gtaf_anaytics_overview} summarises the key facts for this case study.

\footnotetext{The project have subsequently released several of their apps on other platforms, see \url{https://gtaf.org/apps}.}

% \subsection{GTAF: development microcosm} 
The project team hosts their development artefacts on gitlab.com, and they maintain their issues in a publicly-available online database at \url{https://gitlab.com/greentech/}; the source code is private. There is a mix of paid developers (through donations to the charity) and volunteers (often part-time). The developers of some of the less-active apps appear relatively autonomous, which includes their choice and any use of mobile analytics. 

Three of the apps (effectively four, because one app is released as two distinct binaries) were in ongoing active development (\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.quran}{Al Quran},~\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.hadith}{Hadith Collection}, and~\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.hisnulmuslim}{Dua \& Zikr}, which is also released separately in Bangla~\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.hisnulmuslimbn}{{Dua and Zikr (Hisnul Muslim)}}~\emph{in Bengali}); and they planned to revamp two more of the apps (\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.islamicquiz}{(Islamic Quiz)} and~\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greentech.salatbn}{Meaningful prayers (salat)}~\textit{in Bengali}. %, which was called salat in our interview).

The team occasionally used Firebase TestLab~\footnote{\url{https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab}} to test some of the apps, and autonomous `Robo testing'~\footnote{\url{https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-ux-test}}, performed automatically by the test lab, triggered various crashes in the apps being tested. One such example was where an app was missing a `resource'. The team fixed the build by adding the missing resource but did not explicitly retest the app afterward in Firebase.  

\textbf{Data sources:} the data sources obtained in this case study are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:gtaf-data-sources}.

\section{App-centric: Local Halo}~\label{case-study-overview-localhalo}
LocalHalo\index{LocalHalo} was a startup based in London who made a social network for neighbours~\footnote{\url{https://ain.ua/en/2019/10/18/localhalo-raises-500k/}} with developers in Ukraine, London, and Kazakhstan.~\sideparencite{karpenko2019_localhalo_a_social_network_for_neighbors}. 
Table~\ref{tab:local_halo_anaytics_overview} provides an overview of this case study.

The development team used the Expo development platform \url{https://expo.dev/} to create native apps that ran on Android and iOS apps. The mobile app was written in React Native~\footnote{\url{https://reactnative.dev/}} (the associated website is likely to have been written using React js~\footnote{\url{https://reactjs.org/}} and also instrumented using Sentry Analytics which were also available for research purposes). These apps were released on Google Play and Apple's App Store respectively. The \acrshort{cto} was actively involved in writing and maintaining the source code and was supported by developers in three locations, in the Ukraine, London, and Kazakhstan.~\sideparencite{karpenko2019_localhalo_a_social_network_for_neighbors}.  Data in the Sentry mobile analytics reports indicate there was at least one distinct developer in addition to the CTO.

Little additional information was available during conversations in terms of their development or release practices for their mobile apps. One observation is Expo claims to automate the release process to the app stores so the LocalHalo development team may have relied and used the Expo service. And Sentry provided reports on the release numbers and their rollout.

It was released in 2019, with over 150K downloads by early 2020~\sideparencite{objectbox2020_moodspace_interview}. Ian Alexander, the interviewee, was `the software developer, co-founder, and runner of the company'~\sideparencite{objectbox2020_moodspace_interview} so he combined technical and operational responsibilities in his \Gls{cto} role. He is an experienced app developer and also trained as a chemical engineer. The \Gls{cto} was the sole developer.

At the time of the interview the team had developed a complete replacement for the Android app which was due to be launched in a couple of months (around August 2019). The startup was subsequently able to raise a round of funding and grow to six people. The project later returned to be a side-project which is maintained and updated~\sideparencite{alexander2021_linkedin_profile}.

The app had a strong positive User Experience rating of 4.18/5.00~\footnote{\url{https://onemindpsyberguide.org/apps/moodspace/}} which corroborates their objective to provide a beautiful and peaceful mobile app.

The software development department demonstrated high performance engineering in how they approached both public contributions, for instance through hosting Coding DoJos, and in terms of their use of mobile analytics to quickly triage and address pertinent issues.

The engineering organisation consisted of various teams, including a team for the Android app. At the time of the case study, the Android app combined several generations of their architecture and used various third-party libraries. One of these third-party libraries, Robospice, led to a higher crash rate for their Android app on newer releases of Android. The details are discussed in \secref{aiu-engineering-tradeoffs-topic}.

Their software engineering team have been actively involved in encouraging the wider software engineering community to learn and practice good software development practices, for example by hosting Coding DoJos~\footnote{Historical examples available online on twitter \url{https://mobile.twitter.com/moonpigtech} and in a \href{https://www.codurance.com/publications/newsletters/2020-02-13-newsletter}{Codurance newsletter} from February 2020, for example.}. They practiced similar software development practices when developing their production software, for instance in applying Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)~\sideparencite{man2021_moonpig_atdd_part1}.

The Kiwix\index{Kiwix} project started as a way to make Wikipedia available offline, globally~\sideparencite{sutherland2014_wikimedia_on_kelson}. The team wrote software and implemented systems to do so and have worked closely with the WikiMedia Foundation for years. They also make vast amounts of other content available including StackOverflow and TED talks. Innumerable teams, projects, and people use Kiwix in various guises. Table \ref{tab:kiwix_anaytics_overview} provides a succinct overview.

Intentionally the Kiwix project do not integrate mobile analytics in the apps to protect the safety and privacy of users; however, they do use the anonymous platform analytics provided by app stores, including Google Play Console.

The project has multiple opensource projects including software tools that download content from various sources including Wikipedia, web servers that serve content, and a wide range of desktop and mobile apps. I have been a part-time volunteer with Kiwix since 2014. I have contributed to several of their opensource projects including the Android app where I helped with automated testing and with continuous builds, \emph{etc.} %amongst other areas.

One of the many benefits of the project’s openness is the visibility into the developers who have developed and maintained the source code \sidenote{\href{https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/graphs/contributors}{github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/graphs/contributors}}. Many contributors joined as volunteers through Google Summer of Code~\sidecite{google_summer_of_code} or Google Code-in \sidenote{\href{https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/}{codein.withgoogle.com/archive/}. Note: Google Code-in was shutdown and the history archived by Google in 2020.}. Several became core contributors for a year or more, and some now work for leading technology businesses. There have been occasional contributions from Google software developers who volunteer their time. The codebase and development artefacts are all opensource, much of the communications is also publicly accessible, e.g. using GitHub issues, IRC and Slack~\sidenote{\url{https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Communication}}. In addition there are emails and informal discussions, \emph{etc.}

The project uses free-to-use services, \emph{e.g.} GitHub for the codebases. The Continuous Build service was Travis-CI at the time of the case study \sidenote{Since replaced by GitHub Actions} and the project had a \emph{pro bono} account on the commercial BitBar device testing farm~\sidenote{\url{https://bitbar.com/}}. The codebase included a mix of automated unit tests and app tests. In short, the project used fairly well honed tools and practices to manage their codebase, software contributions, perform code quality checks, and run the automated tests on both virtual and physical Android devices.

At the start of the case study there were two parallel releases in progress, the production 2.x release and a planned 3.0 release.

%\subsection{Kiwix: Intervention}
The \textbf{primary intervention} was for several of the team to address several of the most prevalent crashes during the Kiwix hackathon\index{Hackathon} in August 2019, in Stockholm, Sweden. Follow on bug fixes and an increased interest in using mobile analytics outputs led to further improvements in the stability of the main Android app. When the custom apps were refreshed using the improved codebase their stability also increased.

\section{App-centric: Catrobat}~\label{case-study-overview-catrobat}
The Catrobat project was created and is actively developed by a team in the Graz University of Technology, Austria~\sidenote{\url{https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/}}. It consists of the flagship Pocket Code app, several custom branded derivatives, and the increasingly popular \Gls{glossary-pocket-paint}\index{Pocket Paint} app which emerged from the Pocket Code app where it remains as a subset of the overall Pocket Code's functionality. The project started in 2010, has had over 1,300 contributors, 4 million downloads, and 350 thousand active users, and is used in 180+ nations in 60+ languages~\sidecite{catrobat_project}.

The Android app in this case study is an extremely and unusually well researched and properly developed app and codebase.  There are at least 216 contributors for the Android Pocket Code app~\sidecite{github_catroid}.

}

The case study included two main events, 1) a hackathon\index{Hackathon} in November 2019 and 2) participation in a pre-conference workshop in Poland in February 2020. We agreed on a hackathon for a couple of reasons: Kiwix found them beneficial and productive, and the Catrobat team wanted to have a short, unusual and interesting way to try out the concept of using mobile analytics outputs to improve reliability that would also appeal to their developers. 

Their project leads selected Pocket Code as the app we would use for the field experiment as it had the higher crash rate and was also a significantly more complex app than their other core app Pocket Paint which was relatively self-contained and simple in terms of both functionality and codebase.

A second workshop was planned for \nth{28} Feb 2020 . The preparation included opensourced course materials \sidenote{\href{https://github.com/julianharty/testing-with-analytics-workshop/}{github.com/julianharty/testing-with-analytics-workshop/}}. However in the day the workshop did not go as envisaged because of the outbreak of Covid-19\index{COVID-19} that weekend in parts of Europe. Subsequently the project team in Austria was no longer available because of the effects of the pandemic which adversely affected the planned collaboration.

The development microcosm was \textbf{sophisticated} and one of the most mature in terms of opensource mobile app ecosystems~\sidenote{I have worked in opensource for 15 years, including at Google, eBay, and other organisations so I say this based on my professional experience.}.  %\textbf{TODO} check the code coverage for Catrobat.

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=Ranking Catrobat's development practices]
Catrobat is one of a small set of projects who incorporate all the recommended practices. Here are comparisons with two related research papers.

\textbf{Automated tests:} In an admittedly small sample only 9 of 19 opensource Android app projects had any automated tests~\sidecite{silva2016_an_analysis_of_automated_tests_for_mobile_android_apps}. 

And in a larger body of research 40.6\% of 1000 projects have automated tests~\sidecite[][p. 2461]{cruz2019_guess_what_test_your_app}. 

\textbf{CI/CD and automated tests:} 
The Catrobat project has automated tests and CI/CD, only 14.7\% of 1000 opensource Android apps do so~[p. 2461]~\sidenote{Interestingly Cruz~\emph{et al} did not evaluate either Pocket Code or Pocket Paint. They also discounted `self-hosted' CI including Jenkins which Catrobat uses extensively.}

The Jenkins builds measure various forms of code coverage and the results are public: \href{https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid/job/develop/}{jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid/job/develop/}.

\textbf{Promoting good practices:} 
Futhermore, Cruz~\emph{et al} found \emph{``only 19 [of the 1000 projects] are actually promoting full test coverage with coverage tracking services''}~[p. 2462]. The Catrobat project used code quality tools and aims for zero warnings from these tools. They also developed their own custom test automation framework and integrated Fabric Crashlytics into their flagship Pocket Code Android app.

The Android app in this case study is an extremely and unusually well researched and properly developed app and codebase. The project started in 2010, has had over 1,300 contributors, 4 million downloads, and 350 thousand active users, and is used in 180+ nations in 60+ languages~\sidecite{catrobat_project}. There are at least 216 contributors for the Android Pocket Code app~\sidecite{github_catroid}.

Many perceived good practices were and are assiduously applied on an ongoing basis, for instance:~\href{https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid}{Test-Driven Development, Clean Code}~\sidecite{catrobat_first_steps_into}, a documented consistent~\href{https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/wiki/Workflow}{Workflow} and \href{https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/wiki/Creating-a-pull-request}{Pull Requests}, and \href{https://jenkins.catrob.at/job/Catroid/}{Continuous Integration}. The codebase is far more complex than the Kiwix Android apps and the app is significantly richer in terms of the features and functionality~\sidecite{mueller2019_pocketcode}.

\textbf{Catrobat: Interventions:} 
The key intervention was organise a weekend hackathon with an open invitation for any of the extended development team to participate.\todo{TBD whether to describe the planned workshop in any detail.} 
%
During day 1 of the hackathon, after informal introductions and a discussion about the aims of the hackathon, the next task was to create tickets in JIRA for the top 10 crash clusters and the top 10 \acrshort{anr} clusters as reported by Android Vitals\index{Android Vitals}. These were reported in JIRA during the first hour of the hackathon, the complete set are available online at \href{https://jira.catrob.at/browse/CATROID-418?jql=labels\%20\%3D\%20hackathon-2019}{jira.catrob.at/browse/CATROID-418?jql=labels\%20\%3D\%20hackathon-2019}. 

The participants, in ones or twos, selected one of these tickets and worked on it. They then selected another ticket and worked on that one. They continued for approximately 5 hours until late afternoon that day. The event closed with a communal meal at a local pizzeria. The participants chose not to continue with day 2 of the hackathon (which was on the Sunday), instead they preferred to work on the issues during the normal working week (Monday to Friday). Several of them did so and continued to work on various tickets raised in the hackathon. The project team made two related releases of the Pocket Code Android app, with cumulative fixes in these releases.

The researcher accepted a consulting engagement with the corporation and was asked to assist one of their key projects. This project included an Android app, online APIs developed by the larger project team, and other apps, systems and services. It also incorporated other internal systems, APIs, and services provided by other development teams. 

Owing to confidentiality and other contractual obligations details have been removed from this case study. Several practical representative examples have been made available as opensource projects and they are independently able to be corroborated.

The overall project team comprised over 100 people working directly on the product. Developers worked in a matrixed organisation~\sideparencite[describes matrix organisations in detail]{stuckenbruck1979_the_matrix_organization}. Multiple groups of developers worked on the Android app. 

The data was collected contemporaneously during the consulting engagement and subsequently. Details cannot be provided here nonetheless the methods described in the Methodology chapter were used from a research perspective. Extensive field notes were made contemporaneously in addition to contributions to development artefacts. 

\textbf{Intervention:}

The app-centric case studies provided various vectors into a rich and complex area, however as they were all for real world apps in production there were many aspects that did not occur during any of these case studies. During the research there were various field experiments\index{Field experiment} incorporated into the research. These are broadly in three areas:

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Creating small \myindex{Micro Experiments} in the form of Android apps that generally exercise an in-app mobile analytics service in addition to whatever functionality they provide (See \ref{section-small-experimental-android-apps}).

    \item Research into logging performed by Android app developers and the development of software utilities to further that research (Section \ref{section-android-log-centric-experiments}). 
\end{enumerate}

These are followed by research into analysis of the source code of 107 Android apps to learn how developers use Firebase Analytics, more details in Section \ref{section-sourcecode-analysis-to-augment-app-centric-case-studies}.

\subsection{Experimental apps to increase coverage of mobile analytics services}~\label{section-small-experimental-android-apps}
Various tests were performed to augment the app-centric case studies. The tests were packaged as several, small, experimental Android apps; they are not currently intended to go into general release.

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Travel Europe\index{Micro Experiment!Travel Europe}: a pre-release app that incorporated content from Wikipedia and in-app mobile analytics from Microsoft's App Center.
    \item zipternet\index{Micro Experiment!Zipternet}: \url{https://github.com/ISNIT0/zipternet} incorporated Microsoft App Center. %https://github.com/ISNIT0/zipternet/blob/master/app/build.gradle
    \item idot\index{Micro Experiment!idot}: \url{https://github.com/commercetest/idot} (access currently available upon request) incorporated the \myindex{Iteratively} \Gls{sdk}.
    \item AndroidCrashDummy\index{Micro Experiment!Android Crash Dummy}: \url{https://github.com/ISNIT0/AndroidCrashDummy}, used in the log-centric experiments (see \secref{section-android-log-centric-experiments}). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions to opensource mobile analytics projects}~\label{section-contributions-to-opensource-mobile-analytics-projects}
Projects that are opensourced are not necessarily easy to contribute to, there may be various hurdles and sufficient delays to dissuade the majority of developers from actually contributing to those projects. These field experiments\index{Field experiment} were opportunistic in that they emerged as part of the reset of the research, nonetheless they are realistic as they included real-world improvements to those mobile analytics projects and the respective development teams reviewed and approved the contributions.

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item PostHog\index{PostHog}: Two commits to improve the documentation \\ \href{https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/commits?author=julianharty}{github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/commits?author=julianharty}
    \item Sentry\index{Sentry}: Improved the onboarding documentation \\ \href{https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/commits?author=julianharty}{github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/commits?author=julianharty}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PostHog}\index{PostHog}: the research included two commits to their codebase, both improvements to their documentation. They use a an automated `bot', \href{https://www.netlify.com/}{netlify}, that checked the changes and one of their employees approved and merged the changes. A nice gesture was another of their `bot's added me as a contributor to their project, \href{https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5692}{Add julianharty as a contributor}, and they provided a code to obtain some `\href{https://www.dictionary.com/browse/merch}{merch}'\sidenote{A set of three branded mugs and a sticker.}.

\textbf{Sentry}\index{Sentry}: the research consisted of a single commit to their codebase, to improve their developer-oriented documentation. They also use an automated `bot',\href{https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github}{Vercel}, that reviewed the changes and eventually deployed the changes once the code review was completed successfully. The code-review included two of their team where we discussed and refined the change before they accepted it.

In both cases the companies were professional, friendly, and keen to improve the quality of their product and documentation. They provided various mechanisms to help ensure contributions were of sufficient quality and the people involved engaged in discussions about how they worked, \emph{etc.} Both provide clearly visible encouragements for people to participate and contribute. 

\subsection{Android log-centric experiments}~\label{section-android-log-centric-experiments}
Mobile analytics provides mechanisms developers can use to perform implicit and explicit logging where the logs are generated at runtime when the app is being used. This section provides an overview of the log-centric experiments and their related opensource projects; and the next section includes analysis of 107 opensource Android apps that use Firebase Analytics for logging. (\secref{section-sourcecode-analysis-to-augment-app-centric-case-studies}). 

The experiments extracted Android logging statements and then analysed them. This work was complemented with creating Assert statements that automated tests could use to check whether expected log messages had been emitted into the Android log.

The related opensource projects are:

\section{Augmenting the app-centric case studies: sourcecode analysis}~\label{section-sourcecode-analysis-to-augment-app-centric-case-studies}

\index{Analysis!Sourcecode}Sections \ref{case-study-overview-gtaf} to \ref{case-study-overview-moonpig} presents four app-centric case studies where the developers were asked of their experiences of using mobile analytics. This work complemented that research by investigating the source code of 107 opensource projects for active Android apps where the source code was freely available on GitHub. 

What these 107 projects had in common was they used recent releases of Firebase Analytics. 50 of these simply initialised the SDK and did not include any custom calls to the SDK, the remaining 57 did make custom calls. The analysis of the code was jointly performed with an international group of researchers and published in \sidetextcite{harty2021_logging_practices_with_mobile_analytics}. One of these 57 projects, Smartnavi (see Section \ref{case-study-overview-smartnavi}), also became an app-centric case study in that the developer was interviewed about their use of mobile analytics.

Crashlytics\index{Crashlytics} grew from a group of developers who wanted to scratch an itch~\sidecite{chang2015_how_six_people_built_crashlytics} into a product that first Twitter and then Google acquired as it became increasingly popular~\sidecite{___answersblog_2015_june_update}. 
Like many projects and products it morphed over the years and in 2020 Google completed the integration of Crashlytics into Firebase and removed support for older versions of the SDK (which had some knock-on effects in terms of privacy and what the reports contain). Table \ref{tab:crashlytics_case_study_anaytics_overview} provides an overview of Crashlytics.

\section{Tool-centric: Google Play Console with Android Vitals}~\label{case-study-overview-google-play-console-with-android-vitals}
Google Play Console\index{Google Play Console} incorporating Android Vitals\index{Android Vitals} is probably the largest composite source of analytics for mobile apps on Earth as it reports on up to several billion Android devices for the apps on that device~\sidenote{Google does not publish details of how many devices have opted-out of the data being gathered, nor the exact inclusion and exclusion criteria for which apps are reported on so it is hard to determine the overall volumes. Google also owns the most popular in-app mobile analytics service, Firebase. In turn Firebase incorporates a movable feast of analytics offerings including Crashlytics, Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics. These two are almost certainly the top two analytics services on Earth for mobile apps.}.

\newthought{Some history}
In 2010, Google announced an service that appears to be the first version of what became Android Vitals where users could submit crash reports that developers would receive in their Android Market account~\sidecite{androiddevelopersblog2010_android_error_crash_reports}. Google continued to evolve their analytics which included providing developers a mechanism to download crash and \acrshort{anr} reports from 2015~\sidecite{androiddevelopers2015_integrate_play_data_into_your_workflow_with_data_exports} until 2018~\sidecite{google_play_download_and_export_monthly_reports}. Google launched Android Vitals in 2017~\sidecite{androiddevelopersblog2017_android_vitals_increase_engagement_etc}.

%\subsection{Google Play Console with Android Vitals: Background - How the case study came about}
The research into Google Play Console with Android Vitals predates the app-centric case studies. It is one of the \emph{de-facto} mobile analytics tools available to Android developers who release their apps in the Google Play ecosystem. Each of the app-centric case studies provided material related to this service that Google provides free of additional charge~\sidenote{There is a one-off registration fee for creating a developer account for Google Play \href{https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435}{support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435}. Many developers can be added to that account in order to use it and developers can be added to more than one Google Play developer account.}.

\textbf{Google Play Console with Android Vitals: Data collected and methods used for collection}
The data included screenshots, extracts, and rekeying of contents from the interactive use of the mobile analytics service, interactive downloads of various monthly reports provided by the service, automated collection of screenshots and textual content through the use of Vitals Scraper, and material provided by interviewees who emailed screenshots and provided extracts. Source code was located through various searches online and through Grey Data, particularly through StackOverflow.

The CEO confirmed both verbally and by email I was free to reuse their materials including for research purposes. They also accepted contributions to their materials and research, these were freely given and without charge or obligation. I introduced them to someone I worked with who they subsequently hired and they gave both of us permission to freely discuss details of their products, software, and research, again this is without charge or obligation, nonetheless there is an implicit moral obligation to protect sensitive material so shared and which is being upheld during this research.

\textbf{Iteratively with Amplitude: Data collected and methods used for collection}
Field notes were recorded contemporaneously during the various calls and discussions with the founder and with the developer, in addition there are various email (and WhatsApp) discussions. Field notes were also made, together with screenshots, when using the tools and their online reports. The source code for the Android app is also a form of data, and is on GitHub. It is available: currently on request. It will be opensourced at \href{https://github.com/commercetest/idot}{github.com/commercetest/idot}.

\section{Tool-centric: Microsoft App Center}~\label{case-study-overview-microsoft-app-center}
App Center\index{App Center!Microsoft} combines various tools and utilities and includes in-app mobile analytics and crash reporting. The crash reporting aspect probably started as part of the HockeyApp\index{HockeyApp} SDK, Microsoft acquired HockeyApp in late 2016~\footnote{\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20150702124106/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2014/12/11/microsoft-acquires-hockeyapp-leading-mobile-crash-analytics-and-beta-distribution-service-for-ios-android-and-windows-phone.aspx}{http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2014/12/11/microsoft-acquires-hockeyapp-leading-mobile-crash-analytics-and-beta-distribution-service-for-ios-android-and-windows-phone.aspx} (via the Web Archive project)}. The earliest mention of Crash reporting in HockeyApp's opensource Android SDK is in 2014~\footnote{\href{https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Android/commit/3ccd53c44da791806720604b02d358de66ecbf6a}{github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Android/commit/3ccd53c44da791806720604b02d358de66ecbf6a}.}

A related opensource project, \href{https://github.com/bitstadium/CrashProbe}{github.com/bitstadium/CrashProbe}, and a related website called crashprobe.com~\sidenote{The Web Archive has an example from 2016 of: \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20161124205240/http://www.crashprobe.com/}{www.crashprobe.com}.}, compared the performance of various crash reporting SDKs. As it was opensourced developers of several of these SDKs contributed both source code and results. An example of the report from April 2017 has been cached by the web archive \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20170412015831/http://www.crashprobe.com/ios/}{www.crashprobe.com/ios/} and compares the results of 6 iOS crash reporting tools.

\textbf{Estimates of the user base and installations:} As many of the customers are likely to be corporations with large development teams, the ratio is likely to be several developers have access to AppCenter per app. According to AppBrain the App Center SDK has been installed in over 10 thousand apps and those apps have been downloaded over 3 billion times by \nth{25} November 2020 and was in over 13 thousand apps and 30 billion downloads by \nth{16} July 2021. It is in \nth{8} place in the Analytics library category for Android apps. It's also in 6.24\% of top apps, partly as it's included in top Microsoft apps (Microsoft OneDrive, Excel and Word 1 billion+ per app, LinkedIn 500 million, Mirosoft Office 100 million, and Skype Beta 5 million). It's installed in 1.76\% of new apps and 0.24\% of new app installs (App data sourced from~\href{https://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/appcenter/visual-studio-app-center}{www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/appcenter/visual-studio-app-center}).

%\subsection{Microsoft App Center: Background - How the case study came about}
Microsoft App Center was integrated into several field experiment Android apps in 2019. It was also one of the main mobile analytics tools used in the commercial app-centric case study which extended the initial findings from the field experiments into mission-critical and real-world use of the service at scale based on an active end-userbase of millions of people.

\textbf{Microsoft App Center: Data collected and methods used for collection}
Screenshots and data obtained through the reporting APIs were collected as part of the assignment. In tandem field notes, email, and other collaboration tools were used on an ongoing basis during the action research period. Issues reported by others were also observed and analysed, for example in terms of how the issues were tracked, the changes to the app source code, and the subsequent testing of the potential fixes.

Grey Literature describes using Hockey App for crash reporting in iOS~\sidecite{birani2016_hockey_app_for_crash_reporting}, the concepts of how to integrate and test crash reporting for Androids was similar.

\section{Tool-centric: Sentry}~\label{case-study-overview-sentry}
Sentry\index{Sentry} is a a good example of a mature investment-funded purpose-built company who provide various analytics services to their customers. They are one of several who have made their software freely available as opensource (others include Count.ly\index{Count.ly} and PostHog\index{PostHog}). Developers incorporate Sentry's SDKs and/or APIs into their software and can either self-host the necessary server-side software or use the services provided by Sentry. There is a free tier which has basic capabilities, and paid-for options.

%\subsection{Sentry: Background - How the case study came about}
One of the app centric case studies, LocalHalo (\secref{case-study-overview-localhalo}, uses Sentry and they provided access to their Sentry account. The access continued after the action research aspect of that case study and provided an ongoing view of the usage and the behaviours of that app, and the project's website, until November 2021 when pricing changes by Sentry meant my access ceased.

\textbf{Sentry: Data collected and methods used for collection}

Data was collected interactively, via automated emails, and using their API service.

\textbf{Sentry: Contributions to the research}

\section{Miscellaneous sources of minor contributions}~\label{section-case-study-misc-contributions}

These include an opensource project, EduVPN\index{EduVPN}, and six more mobile analytics software tools and associated services: AppPulse Mobile\index{AppPulse Mobile!HP}, AppSee\index{AppSee}, Azetone\index{Azetone}, Count.ly\index{Count.ly}, MixPanel\index{MixPanel}, PostHog\index{PostHog}, and SegmentIO\index{SegmentIO}. For the first three of these I worked indirectly with the development team, evaluated the product and service and provided bug reports and other feedback. These engagements were part of my consulting work with and for what became HP Enterprise (and subsequently was acquired by MicroFocus). Some material has been published in \sidetextcite{harty_aymer_playbook_2016}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item AppPulse Mobile: an innovative mobile analytics service that automatically instrumented Android apps during the build process of that app. The service provided crash and performance reporting. It was developed by HP, it is now owned by MicroFocus. 
    \item AppSee: the first of two `heatmapping' tools that included mobile analytics of the data collected by their in-app library. The company and their products were acquired and are no longer available.
    \item Azetone: the second of the two `heatmapping' tools. Their online presence indicates they continue to provide a similar product and service.
    \item Countly: one of the early opensource mobile analytics offerings, they offered a relatively simple complete end-to-end package with the client-side SDK and server.
    \item MixPanel: an early closed-source mobile analytics offering.
    \item SegmentIO: another long-term opensource mobile analytics offering, acquired in 2020 by Twilio. Their source code and issues database include various useful exemplary examples; these have contributed to the grey materials used in this research. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary of the case studies overview}~\label{case-study-overview-summary}
This chapter covered a lot of ground. In summary the research includes learning how mobile analytics tools are used from the developers' perspective, some action research, software experiments, and analysis of Android apps that use the most popular mobile analytics service: Firebase Analytics. It then introduces tool centric case studies and finally miscellaneous additional sources of research material.

The next three chapters are a set and structured around the six perspectives. They provide findings aligned with three distinct focal points: first the processes used by app developers; second the products of their work, particularly in terms of improving the product artefacts. The third chapter in the set focuses on the mobile analytics tools and related services. Each chapter considers the status-quo and improvements to the status-quo. Sometimes they build on work presented in another of this set of chapters, for example they may cross-reference e.g. in their respective discussion section.
