\chapter{Overview of the case studies}~\label{chapter-case-studies-overview}

In the previous chapter app-centric and tool-centric case studies were introduced, together with the procedure used for the app-centric case studies. This chapter builds on their work and introduces each case study using a consistent structure to make them easy to comprehend and to facilitate their comparisons. Three subsequent, contiguous chapters will each address the temporal dimensions (understanding and improvement) of an object of analysis (use, artefacts, and tools). These will in turn be followed by the discussion chapter.
