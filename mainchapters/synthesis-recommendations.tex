\section{Synthesis and Recommendations}
\label{section-synthesis-recommendations}

This section synthesises the overall findings to provide some recommendations for how development teams can apply analytics productively in their ongoing work. Several cadences have emerged so far that align with a) new releases of an app b) operational, `business-as-usual', once a release has been rolled out and reached the majority of uses who will install it. Note: There will also be times when the development team needs to adapt and respond to emerging events where applying analytics is also relevant, these are outside the scope of this thesis.

\subsection{Mobile Analytics Policy}
A~\href{glossary-mobile-analytics-policy}{Mobile Analytics Policy} helps the team distinguish the boundaries of their use of mobile analytics, for instance whether they are willing to include analytics as part of their mobile app, and if so the limits of the data the analytics would be allowed to collect and who would, and who would not, have access to the contents of the underlying data. In the case studies, the non-for-profit projects (Kiwix, Catrobat, and Greentech) have all chosen not to use in-app analytics libraries. Catrobat chose to do so when Google removed access to the Fabric Crashlytics service as the replacement Firebase Crashlytics service collected and reported on data considered sensitive and unnecessary by the project team.

\subsubsection{Combining policy and strategy}
There can be areas that blur between policy and strategy, for instance on whether to use a third-party provider of analytics - the reasons may be for a mix of both policy and strategy aspects. On example is a team may have a policy of only using external offerings when they do not cost money and have a strategy of using and reusing pre-existing offerings rather than creating custom software. External analytics offerings could potentially meet both the policy and strategy, however if the cost is measured in external data access and external use of that data e.g. to profile users then that service offering may be excluded from a policy perspective.
