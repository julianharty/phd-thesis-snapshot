\section{Research Questions}
\label{section-research-questions}
%%%%%%%%%% Isabel Evans suggests adding a table with my RQs at the start of this section. TBD. COULD-DO. Certainly it seems this section needs polish.

%MUST-DO \yijun{If possible, you may need to dig out a few MobileSoft research papers to give evidence that these research questions have not been addressed in literature, e.g., \emph{Future Trends in Software Engineering Research for Mobile Apps}~\sidecite{nagappan2016_future_trends_in_sw_eng_for_mobile_apps}, whether the future work of some paper suggests one does not know the sources, value, or impact of mobile analytics to assess and improve app quality? Is there nothing in the general SE literature studying the "analytics" to "general software quality" problem? If there are such general work, how does "mobile analytics" and "app quality" differentiate the RQs to existing ones...}


My research hypothesis is that using mobile analytics can help improve both the work development teams do and the quality of the products they create. Here work includes the development, testing, and bug investigation of the software being created. For the quality of the product, this research is focusing on a subset of qualities which are technology-centric.

The core question the research aims to consider is:

  \emph{How can applying analytics improve software development and software testing for mobile apps in practice?}~\label{overall-research-question}\index{Research questions}

In order to answer this research question it is appropriate to consider improvements to the \emph{app i.e. the product} and to the \emph{processes/practices} development teams apply when they develop and maintain their mobile apps. Improvements cannot be be usefully considered in isolation, they need to be grounded in the current practices: the developers will have their perspectives on their use of mobile analytics, and their development artefacts may provide cross-verification of what they say they do compared with tangible evidence of how they use those mobile analytics tools. 

Furthermore, there may be constraints and/or limitations in the current mobile analytics tools which may adversely affect the improvements development teams are able to make to their processes/practices and to their products, hence it is also germane to consider improvements to the current mobile analytics tools.

These additional supporting questions can be restated as six distinct yet related perspectives.

\subsection{Research questions lead to six perspectives}~\label{rq-leads-to-six-perspectives}
The six perspectives are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:six-perspectives-in-the-research-questions-section}~\sidenote{Source figure:~\href{https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1SafKu3uqgl-s8-I8iWSSWmFY4NdlNpw8v6ZiJDGh50c/edit?usp=sharing}{Google Docs: Six Perspectives drawing}.} and paraphrased below:

\begin{enumerate}
    %\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em} %\itemsep0em
    \item [1a] What do app developers say they do? (understand the \emph{status quo} from their perspective).\index{Research questions}
    \item [2a] What's possible in terms of improving their processes, their practices?)
    \item [1b] What does their source code (and other available development artefacts) tell us about their use of mobile analytics? (\emph{i.e.} to understand current behaviours in terms of the code that's implemented.
    \item [2b] What's possible in terms of improving the product (and particularly the mobile app) through the application/use of mobile analytics?
    \item [1c] What do we learn about various current mobile analytics tools?
    \item [2c] What improvements are possible for mobile analytics tools based on what was learned in the various case studies?
\end{enumerate}

These provide clear grouping for each of the three columns: on processes (a), on apps and related development artefacts (b), and on the analytics tools (c) which are considered in terms of first understanding and then improving the \emph{status-quo}, shown as two rows, \emph{i.e.} a 3x2 matrix.

Here the hypothesis is that analytics can help, as stated by Buse and Zimmermann ~(\citeyear{buse_analytics_2010}); and \emph{``with explicit and implicit feedback now available (almost) continuously, questions arise. How can practitioners use this information and integrate it into their development processes [to decide when to release updates]?"}~\sidecite{maalej2016_towards_data_driven_requirements_engineering}.
