A short test of the table below:


\begin{table}
	\footnotesize % Reduce font size
    \begin{tabular}{L{0.05\textwidth} L{0.35\textwidth} L{0.4\textwidth}}
    %\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1cm}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3cm}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{4cm}}
        \toprule
        ID & Flaw & Consequences \\
        \midrule
        01 & Testing discouraged & Limits investigation into behaviours and their impacts. \\
        02 & Negative populations & Nonsensical and therefore untrustworthy statistics \\
        03 & Repeated graphs & Poor UX, waste of space (waste of real estate). \\
        04 & Gaps in the data & `Flying blind', loss of confidence in the service. \\
        05 & Inconsistent data ranges for some reports & Poor UX, confusing, may lead to incorrect/flawed decisions. \\
        06 & Missing URL parameters & Results incorrectly filtered. \\
        07 & No updates for 10+ days & `Flying blind', loss of confidence in the service. \\
        08 & Incorrect ranges in reports & Off-by-one errors. \\
        09 & Unexplained negative headline rate & TBD, I've forgotten what this was. \\
        10 & Poor grouping of clusters & Inaccurate summaries, rank of failures skewed, sub-optimal prioritisation. \\
        11 & No Service problem-reporting & Lack of transparency of historical service outages, \emph{etc.} \\
        12 & Lack of reports (despite usage) & Unusable analytics for low to mid range usage by end users, `Flying blind' after take-off. \\
        13 & Second country's data conflated with that of the first & Misleading report, poor UX. \\
        14 & 10x mismatch with crashlytics & Lack of trust in at least one of the mobile analytics tools. \\
        15 & Incorrect date for last update & Misleading developer experience, loss of trust in the service. \\
        16 & Several identical crash clusters in the paged list of ranked results, e.g. \href{https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/issues/2482}{Kiwix issue 2482}. & Adversely affects counts of matching crash clusters, confusing. \\
        \bottomrule
%         17 & Future times and dates in Microsoft App Center reports.
%       18 & Data missing from stack traces.
